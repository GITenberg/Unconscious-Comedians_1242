      UNCONSCIOUS COMEDIANS
    </h1>
    <p>
      Leon de Lora, our celebrated landscape painter, belongs to one of the
      noblest families of the Roussillon (Spanish originally) which, although
      distinguished for the antiquity of its race, has been doomed for a century
      to the proverbial poverty of hidalgos. Coming, light-footed, to Paris from
      the department of the Eastern Pyrenees, with the sum of eleven francs in
      his pocket for all viaticum, he had in some degree forgotten the miseries
      and privations of his childhood and his family amid the other privations
      and miseries which are never lacking to &ldquo;rapins,&rdquo; whose whole fortune
      consists of intrepid vocation. Later, the cares of fame and those of
      success were other causes of forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have followed the capricious and meandering course of these
      studies, perhaps you will remember Mistigris, Schinner&rsquo;s pupil, one of the
      heroes of &ldquo;A Start in Life&rdquo; (Scenes from Private Life), and his brief
      apparitions in other Scenes. In 1845, this landscape painter, emulator of
      the Hobbemas, Ruysdaels, and Lorraines, resembles no more the shabby,
      frisky rapin whom we then knew. Now an illustrious man, he owns a charming
      house in the rue de Berlin, not far from the hotel de Brambourg, where his
      friend Brideau lives, and quite close to the house of Schinner, his early
      master. He is a member of the Institute and an officer of the Legion of
      honor; he is thirty-six years old, has an income of twenty thousand francs
      from the Funds, his pictures sell for their weight in gold, and (what
      seems to him more extraordinary than the invitations he receives
      occasionally to court balls) his name and fame, mentioned so often for the
      last sixteen years by the press of Europe, has at last penetrated to the
      valley of the Eastern Pyrenees, where vegetate three veritable Loras: his
      father, his eldest brother, and an old paternal aunt, Mademoiselle Urraca
      y Lora.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the maternal line the painter has no relation left except a cousin, the
      nephew of his mother, residing in a small manufacturing town in the
      department. This cousin was the first to bethink himself of Leon. But it
      was not until 1840 that Leon de Lora received a letter from Monsieur
      Sylvestre Palafox-Castal-Gazonal (called simply Gazonal) to which he
      replied that he was assuredly himself,&mdash;that is to say, the son of
      the late Leonie Gazonal, wife of Comte Fernand Didas y Lora.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer of 1841 cousin Sylvestre Gazonal went to inform the
      illustrious unknown family of Lora that their little Leon had not gone to
      the Rio de la Plata, as they supposed, but was now one of the greatest
      geniuses of the French school of painting; a fact the family did not
      believe. The eldest son, Don Juan de Lora assured his cousin Gazonal that
      he was certainly the dupe of some Parisian wag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the said Gazonal was intending to go to Paris to prosecute a lawsuit
      which the prefect of the Eastern Pyrenees had arbitrarily removed from the
      usual jurisdiction, transferring it to that of the Council of State. The
      worthy provincial determined to investigate this act, and to ask his
      Parisian cousin the reason of such high-handed measures. It thus happened
      that Monsieur Gazonal came to Paris, took shabby lodgings in the rue
      Croix-des-Petits-Champs, and was amazed to see the palace of his cousin in
      the rue de Berlin. Being told that the painter was then travelling in
      Italy, he renounced, for the time being, the intention of asking his
      advice, and doubted if he should ever find his maternal relationship
      acknowledged by so great a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the years 1843 and 1844 Gazonal attended to his lawsuit. This suit
      concerned a question as to the current and level of a stream of water and
      the necessity of removing a dam, in which dispute the administration,
      instigated by the abutters on the river banks, had meddled. The removal of
      the dam threatened the existence of Gazonal&rsquo;s manufactory. In 1845,
      Gazonal considered his cause as wholly lost; the secretary of the Master
      of Petitions, charged with the duty of drawing up the report, had confided
      to him that the said report would assuredly be against him, and his own
      lawyer confirmed the statement. Gazonal, though commander of the National
      Guard in his own town and one of the most capable manufacturers of the
      department, found himself of so little account in Paris, and he was,
      moreover, so frightened by the costs of living and the dearness of even
      the most trifling things, that he kept himself, all this time, secluded in
      his shabby lodgings. The Southerner, deprived of his sun, execrated Paris,
      which he called a manufactory of rheumatism. As he added up the costs of
      his suit and his living, he vowed within himself to poison the prefect on
      his return, or to minotaurize him. In his moments of deepest sadness he
      killed the prefect outright; in gayer mood he contented himself with
      minotaurizing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning as he ate his breakfast and cursed his fate, he picked up a
      newspaper savagely. The following lines, ending an article, struck Gazonal
      as if the mysterious voice which speaks to gamblers before they win had
      sounded in his ear: &ldquo;Our celebrated landscape painter, Leon de Lora,
      lately returned from Italy, will exhibit several pictures at the Salon;
      thus the exhibition promises, as we see, to be most brilliant.&rdquo; With the
      suddenness of action that distinguishes the sons of the sunny South,
      Gazonal sprang from his lodgings to the street, from the street to a
      street-cab, and drove to the rue de Berlin to find his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leon de Lora sent word by a servant to his cousin Gazonal that he invited
      him to breakfast the next day at the Cafe de Paris, but he was now engaged
      in a matter which did not allow him to receive his cousin at the present
      moment. Gazonal, like a true Southerner, recounted all his troubles to the
      valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day at ten o&rsquo;clock, Gazonal, much too well-dressed for the
      occasion (he had put on his bottle-blue coat with brass buttons, a frilled
      shirt, a white waistcoat and yellow gloves), awaited his amphitryon a full
      hour, stamping his feet on the boulevard, after hearing from the master of
      the cafe that &ldquo;these gentlemen&rdquo; breakfasted habitually between eleven and
      twelve o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between eleven and half-past,&rdquo; he said when he related his adventures to
      his cronies in the provinces, &ldquo;two Parisians dressed in simple
      frock-coats, looking like <i>nothing at all</i>, called out when they saw
      me on the boulevard, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s our Gazonal!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was Bixiou, with whom Leon de Lora had armed himself to &ldquo;bring
      out&rdquo; his provincial cousin, in other words, to make him pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be vexed, cousin, I&rsquo;m at your service!&rsquo; cried out that little
      Leon, taking me in his arms,&rdquo; related Gazonal on his return home. &ldquo;The
      breakfast was splendid. I thought I was going blind when I saw the number
      of bits of gold it took to pay that bill. Those fellows must earn their
      weight in gold, for I saw my cousin give the waiter <i>thirty sous</i>&mdash;the
      price of a whole day&rsquo;s work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this monstrous breakfast&mdash;advisedly so called in view of six
      dozen Osten oysters, six cutlets a la Soubise, a chicken a la Marengo,
      lobster mayonnaise, green peas, a mushroom pasty, washed down with three
      bottles of Bordeaux, three bottles of Champagne, plus coffee and liqueurs,
      to say nothing of relishes&mdash;Gazonal was magnificent in his diatribes
      against Paris. The worthy manufacturer complained of the length of the
      four-pound bread-loaves, the height of the houses, the indifference of the
      passengers in the streets to one another, the cold, the rain, the cost of
      hackney-coaches, all of which and much else he bemoaned in so witty a
      manner that the two artists took a mighty fancy to cousin Gazonal, and
      made him relate his lawsuit from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lawsuit,&rdquo; he said in his Southern accent and rolling his r&rsquo;s, &ldquo;is a
      very simple thing; they want my manufactory. I&rsquo;ve employed here in Paris a
      dolt of a lawyer, to whom I give twenty francs every time he opens an eye,
      and he is always asleep. He&rsquo;s a slug, who drives in his coach, while I go
      afoot and he splashes me. I see now I ought to have had a carriage! On the
      other hand, that Council of State are a pack of do-nothings, who leave
      their duties to little scamps every one of whom is bought up by our
      prefect. That&rsquo;s my lawsuit! They want my manufactory! Well, they&rsquo;ll get
      it! and they must manage the best they can with my workmen, a hundred of
      &lsquo;em, who&rsquo;ll make them sing another tune before they&rsquo;ve done with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years. Ha! that meddling prefect! he shall pay dear for this; I&rsquo;ll
      have his life if I have to give mine on the scaffold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which state councillor presides over your section?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A former newspaper man,&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t pay ten sous in taxes,&mdash;his
      name is Massol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two Parisians exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the commissioner who is making the report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s still more queer; he&rsquo;s Master of Petitions, professor of
      something or other at the Sorbonne,&mdash;a fellow who writes things in
      reviews, and for whom I have the profoundest contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claude Vignon,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s his name,&rdquo; replied Gazonal. &ldquo;Massol and Vignon&mdash;there
      you have Social Reason, in which there&rsquo;s no reason at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some way out of it,&rdquo; said Leon de Lora. &ldquo;You see, cousin,
      all things are possible in Paris for good as well as for evil, for the
      just as well as the unjust. There&rsquo;s nothing that can&rsquo;t be done, undone,
      and redone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take me if I stay ten days more in this hole of a place, the
      dullest in all France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two cousins and Bixiou were at this moment walking from one end to the
      other of that sheet of asphalt on which, between the hours of one and
      three, it is difficult to avoid seeing some of the personages in honor of
      whom Fame puts one or the other of her trumpets to her lips. Formerly that
      locality was the Place Royale; next it was the Pont Neuf; in these days
      this privilege had been acquired by the Boulevard des Italiens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris,&rdquo; said the painter to his cousin, &ldquo;is an instrument on which we
      must know how to play; if we stand here ten minutes I&rsquo;ll give you your
      first lesson. There, look!&rdquo; he said, raising his cane and pointing to a
      couple who were just then coming out from the Passage de l&rsquo;Opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness! who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>That</i> was an old woman, in a bonnet which had spent six months in a
      show-case, a very pretentious gown and a faded tartan shawl, whose face
      had been buried twenty years of her life in a damp lodge, and whose
      swollen hand-bag betokened no better social position than that of an
      ex-portress. With her was a slim little girl, whose eyes, fringed with
      black lashes, had lost their innocence and showed great weariness; her
      face, of a pretty shape, was fresh and her hair abundant, her forehead
      charming but audacious, her bust thin,&mdash;in other words, an unripe
      fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Bixiou, &ldquo;is a rat tied to its mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rat!&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That particular rat,&rdquo; said Leon, with a friendly nod to Mademoiselle
      Ninette, &ldquo;may perhaps win your suit for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal bounded; but Bixiou had held him by the arm ever since they left
      the cafe, thinking perhaps that the flush on his face was rather vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That rat, who is just leaving a rehearsal at the Opera-house, is going
      home to eat a miserable dinner, and will return about three o&rsquo;clock to
      dress, if she dances in the ballet this evening&mdash;as she will, to-day
      being Monday. This rat is already an old rat for she is thirteen years of
      age. Two years from now that creature may be worth sixty thousand francs;
      she will be all or nothing, a great danseuse or a marcheuse, a celebrated
      person or a vulgar courtesan. She has worked hard since she was eight
      years old. Such as you see her, she is worn out with fatigue; she
      exhausted her body this morning in the dancing-class, she is just leaving
      a rehearsal where the evolutions are as complicated as a Chinese puzzle;
      and she&rsquo;ll go through them again to-night. The rat is one of the primary
      elements of the Opera; she is to the leading danseuse what a junior clerk
      is to a notary. The rat is&mdash;hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who produces the rat?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porters, paupers, actors, dancers,&rdquo; replied Bixiou. &ldquo;Only the lowest
      depths of poverty could force a child to subject her feet and joints to
      positive torture, to keep herself virtuous out of mere speculation until
      she is eighteen years of age, and to live with some horrible old crone
      like a beautiful plant in a dressing of manure. You shall see now a
      procession defiling before you, one after the other, of men of talent,
      little and great, artists in seed or flower, who are raising to the glory
      of France that every-day monument called the Opera, an assemblage of
      forces, wills, and forms of genius, nowhere collected as in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already seen the Opera,&rdquo; said Gazonal, with a self-sufficient air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, from a three-francs-sixty-sous seat among the gods,&rdquo; replied the
      landscape painter; &ldquo;just as you have seen Paris in the rue
      Croix-des-Petits-Champs, without knowing anything about it. What did they
      give at the Opera when you were there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guillaume Tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;Matilde&rsquo;s grand DUO must have delighted you. What do
      you suppose that charming singer did when she left the stage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;well, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ate two bloody mutton-chops which her servant had ready for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malibran kept up on brandy&mdash;but it killed her in the end. Another
      thing! You have seen the ballet, and you&rsquo;ll now see it defiling past you
      in its every-day clothes, without knowing that the face of your lawsuit
      depends on a pair of those legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lawsuit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, cousin, here comes what is called a marcheuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leon pointed to one of those handsome creatures who at twenty-five years
      of age have lived sixty, and whose beauty is so real and so sure of being
      cultivated that they make no display of it. She was tall, and walked well,
      with the arrogant look of a dandy; her toilet was remarkable for its
      ruinous simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Carabine,&rdquo; said Bixiou, who gave her, as did Leon, a slight nod
      to which she responded by a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another who may possibly get your prefect turned out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A marcheuse!&mdash;but what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A marcheuse is a rat of great beauty whom her mother, real or fictitious,
      has sold as soon as it was clear she would become neither first, second,
      nor third danseuse, but who prefers the occupation of coryphee to any
      other, for the main reason that having spent her youth in that employment
      she is unfitted for any other. She has been rejected at the minor theatres
      where they want danseuses; she has not succeeded in the three towns where
      ballets are given; she has not had the money, or perhaps the desire to go
      to foreign countries&mdash;for perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that the great
      school of dancing in Paris supplies the whole world with male and female
      dancers. Thus a rat who becomes a marcheuse,&mdash;that is to say, an
      ordinary figurante in a ballet,&mdash;must have some solid attachment
      which keeps her in Paris: either a rich man she does not love or a poor
      man she loves too well. The one you have just seen pass will probably
      dress and redress three times this evening,&mdash;as a princess, a
      peasant-girl, a Tyrolese; by which she will earn about two hundred francs
      a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is better dressed than my prefect&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should go to her house,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;you would find there a
      chamber-maid, a cook, and a man-servant. She occupies a fine apartment in
      the rue Saint-Georges; in short, she is, in proportion to French fortunes
      of the present day compared with those of former times, a relic of the
      eighteenth century &lsquo;opera-girl.&rsquo; Carabine is a power; at this moment she
      governs du Tillet, a banker who is very influential in the Chamber of
      Deputies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And above these two rounds in the ballet ladder what comes next?&rdquo; asked
      Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said his cousin, pointing to an elegant caleche which was turning
      at that moment from the boulevard into the rue Grange-Bateliere, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      one of the leading danseuses whose name on the posters attracts all Paris.
      That woman earns sixty thousand francs a year and lives like a princess;
      the price of your manufactory all told wouldn&rsquo;t suffice to buy you the
      privilege of bidding her good-morning a dozen times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;that young man who is sitting on the front
      seat of her carriage? Well, he&rsquo;s a viscount who bears a fine old name;
      he&rsquo;s her first gentleman of the bed-chamber; does all her business with
      the newspapers; carries messages of peace or war in the morning to the
      director of the Opera; and takes charge of the applause which salutes her
      as she enters or leaves the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my good friends, that&rsquo;s the finishing touch! I see now that I
      knew nothing of the ways of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, you are learning what you can see in ten minutes in the
      Passage de l&rsquo;Opera,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;Look there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two persons, a man and a woman, came out of the Passage at that moment.
      The woman was neither plain nor pretty; but her dress had that distinction
      of style and cut and color which reveals an artist; the man had the air of
      a singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;is a baritone and a second danseuse. The baritone
      is a man of immense talent, but a baritone voice being only an accessory
      to the other parts he scarcely earns what the second danseuse earns. The
      danseuse, who was celebrated before Taglioni and Ellsler appeared, has
      preserved to our day some of the old traditions of the character dance and
      pantomime. If the two others had not revealed in the art of dancing a
      poetry hitherto unperceived, she would have been the leading talent; as it
      is, she is reduced to the second line. But for all that, she fingers her
      thirty thousand francs a year, and her faithful friend is a peer of
      France, very influential in the Chamber. And see! there&rsquo;s a danseuse of
      the third order, who, as a dancer, exists only through the omnipotence of
      a newspaper. If her engagement were not renewed the ministry would have
      one more journalistic enemy on its back. The corps de ballet is a great
      power; consequently it is considered better form in the upper ranks of
      dandyism and politics to have relations with dance than with song. In the
      stalls, where the habitues of the Opera congregate, the saying &lsquo;Monsieur
      is all for singing&rsquo; is a form of ridicule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short man with a common face, quite simply dressed, passed them at this
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the other half of the Opera receipts&mdash;that man who just went
      by; the tenor. There is no longer any play, poem, music, or representation
      of any kind possible unless some celebrated tenor can reach a certain
      note. The tenor is love, he is the Voice that touches the heart, that
      vibrates in the soul, and his value is reckoned at a much higher salary
      than that of a minister. One hundred thousand francs for a throat, one
      hundred thousand francs for a couple of ankle-bones,&mdash;those are the
      two financial scourges of the Opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am amazed,&rdquo; said Gazonal, &ldquo;at the hundreds of thousands of francs
      walking about here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll amaze you a good deal more, my dear cousin,&rdquo; said Leon de Lora.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take Paris as an artist takes his violoncello, and show you how it
      is played,&mdash;in short, how people amuse themselves in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a kaleidoscope with a circumference of twenty miles,&rdquo; cried
      Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before piloting monsieur about, I have to see Gaillard,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can use Gaillard for the cousin,&rdquo; replied Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of machine is that?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a machine, he is a machinist. Gaillard is a friend of ours who
      has ended a miscellaneous career by becoming the editor of a newspaper,
      and whose character and finances are governed by movements comparable to
      those of the tides. Gaillard can contribute to make you win your lawsuit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very moment to win it,&rdquo; replied Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached Theodore Gaillard&rsquo;s abode, which was now in the rue de
      Menars, the valet ushered the three friends into a boudoir and asked them
      to wait, as monsieur was in secret conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo; asked Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a man who is selling him the incarceration of an <i>unseizable</i>
      debtor,&rdquo; replied a handsome woman who now appeared in a charming morning
      toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, my dear Suzanne,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;I am certain we may go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a beautiful creature!&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Madame Gaillard,&rdquo; replied Leon de Lora, speaking low into his
      cousin&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;She is the most humble-minded woman in Paris, for she had
      the public and has contented herself with a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your will, messeigneurs?&rdquo; said the facetious editor, seeing his
      two friends and imitating Frederic Lemaitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore Gaillard, formerly a wit, had ended by becoming a stupid man in
      consequence of remaining constantly in one centre,&mdash;a moral
      phenomenon frequently to be observed in Paris. His principal method of
      conversation consisted in sowing his speeches with sayings taken from
      plays then in vogue and pronounced in imitation of well-known actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come to blague,&rdquo; said Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Again, young men&rsquo;&rdquo; (Odry in the Saltimbauques).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this time, we&rsquo;ve got him, sure,&rdquo; said Gaillard&rsquo;s other visitor,
      apparently by way of conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Are</i> you sure of it, pere Fromenteau?&rdquo; asked Gaillard. &ldquo;This it the
      eleventh time you&rsquo;ve caught him at night and missed him in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I help it? I never saw such a debtor! he&rsquo;s a locomotive; goes
      to sleep in Paris and wakes up in the Seine-et-Oise. A safety lock I call
      him.&rdquo; Seeing a smile on Gaillard&rsquo;s face he added: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a saying in our
      business. Pinch a man, means arrest him, lock him up. The criminal police
      have another term. Vidoeq said to his man, &lsquo;You are served&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s
      funnier, for it means the guillotine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A nudge from Bixiou made Gazonal all eyes and ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does monsieur grease my paws?&rdquo; asked Fromenteau of Gaillard, in a
      threatening but cool tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A question that of fifty centimes&rsquo;&rdquo; (Les Saltimbauques), replied the
      editor, taking out five francs and offering them to Fromenteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the rapscallions?&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rapscallions?&rdquo; asked Gaillard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those I employ,&rdquo; replied Fromenteau calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a lower depth still?&rdquo; asked Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; said the spy. &ldquo;Some people give us information without
      knowing they do so, and without getting paid for it. I put fools and
      ninnies below rapscallions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are often original, and witty, your rapscallions!&rdquo; said Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you belong to the police?&rdquo; asked Gazonal, eying with uneasy curiosity
      the hard, impassible little man, who was dressed like the third clerk in a
      sheriff&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which police do you mean?&rdquo; asked Fromenteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As many as five,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;Criminal, the head of which was
      Vidoeq; secret police, which keeps an eye on the other police, the head of
      it being always unknown; political police,&mdash;that&rsquo;s Fouche&rsquo;s. Then
      there&rsquo;s the police of Foreign Affairs, and finally, the palace police (of
      the Emperor, Louis XVIII., etc.), always squabbling with that of the quai
      Malaquais. It came to an end under Monsieur Decazes. I belonged to the
      police of Louis XVIII.; I&rsquo;d been in it since 1793, with that poor
      Contenson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The four gentlemen looked at each other with one thought: &ldquo;How many heads
      he must have brought to the scaffold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now-a-days, they are trying to get on without us. Folly!&rdquo; continued the
      little man, who began to seem terrible. &ldquo;Since 1830 they want honest men
      at the prefecture! I resigned, and I&rsquo;ve made myself a small vocation by
      arresting for debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the right arm of the commercial police,&rdquo; said Gaillard in Bixiou&rsquo;s
      ear, &ldquo;but you can never find out who pays him most, the debtor or the
      creditor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more rascally a business is, the more honor it needs. I&rsquo;m for him who
      pays me best,&rdquo; continued Fromenteau addressing Gaillard. &ldquo;You want to
      recover fifty thousand francs and you talk farthings to your means of
      action. Give me five hundred francs and your man is pinched to-night, for
      we spotted him yesterday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred francs for you alone!&rdquo; cried Theodore Gaillard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizette wants a shawl,&rdquo; said the spy, not a muscle of his face moving. &ldquo;I
      call her Lizette because of Beranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a Lizette, and you stay in such a business!&rdquo; cried the virtuous
      Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is amusing! People may cry up the pleasures of hunting and fishing as
      much as they like but to stalk a man in Paris is far better fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Gazonal, reflectively, speaking to himself, &ldquo;they must
      have great talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to enumerate the qualities which make a man remarkable in our
      vocation,&rdquo; said Fromenteau, whose rapid glance had enabled him to fathom
      Gazonal completely, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d think I was talking of a man of genius. First,
      we must have the eyes of a lynx; next, audacity (to tear into houses like
      bombs, accost the servants as if we knew them, and propose treachery&mdash;always
      agreed to); next, memory, sagacity, invention (to make schemes, conceived
      rapidly, never the same&mdash;for spying must be guided by the characters
      and habits of the persons spied upon; it is a gift of heaven); and,
      finally, agility, vigor. All these facilities and qualities, monsieur, are
      depicted on the door of the Gymnase-Amoros as Virtue. Well, we must have
      them all, under pain of losing the salaries given us by the State, the rue
      de Jerusalem, or the minister of Commerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly seem to me a remarkable man,&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fromenteau looked at the provincial without replying, without betraying
      the smallest sign of feeling, and departed, bowing to no one,&mdash;a
      trait of real genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, cousin, you have now seen the police incarnate,&rdquo; said Leon to
      Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has something the effect of a dinner-pill,&rdquo; said the worthy
      provincial, while Gaillard and Bixiou were talking together in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an answer to-night at Carabine&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Gaillard aloud,
      re-seating himself at his desk without seeing or bowing to Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a rude fellow!&rdquo; cried the Southerner as they left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His paper has twenty-two thousand subscribers,&rdquo; said Leon de Lora. &ldquo;He is
      one of the five great powers of the day, and he hasn&rsquo;t, in the morning,
      the time to be polite. Now,&rdquo; continued Leon, speaking to Bixiou, &ldquo;if we
      are going to the Chamber to help him with his lawsuit let us take the
      longest way round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Words said by great men are like silver-gilt spoons with the gilt washed
      off; by dint of repetition they lose their brilliancy,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
      &ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, close by, to our hatter?&rdquo; replied Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Bixiou. &ldquo;If we keep on in this way, we shall have an
      amusing day of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gazonal,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;I shall make the man pose for you; but mind that
      you keep a serious face, like the king on a five-franc piece, for you are
      going to see a choice original, a man whose importance has turned his
      head. In these days, my dear fellow, under our new political dispensation,
      every human being tries to cover himself with glory, and most of them
      cover themselves with ridicule; hence a lot of living caricatures quite
      new to the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If everybody gets glory, who can be famous?&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fame! none but fools want that,&rdquo; replied Bixiou. &ldquo;Your cousin wears the
      cross, but I&rsquo;m the better dressed of the two, and it is I whom people are
      looking at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this remark, which may explain why orators and other great statesmen
      no longer put the ribbon in their buttonholes when in Paris, Leon showed
      Gazonal a sign, bearing, in golden letters, the illustrious name of
      &ldquo;Vital, successor to Finot, manufacturer of hats&rdquo; (no longer &ldquo;hatter&rdquo; as
      formerly), whose advertisements brought in more money to the newspapers
      than those of any half-dozen vendors of pills or sugarplums,&mdash;the
      author, moreover, of an essay on hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Bixiou to Gazonal, pointing to the splendors of the
      show-window, &ldquo;Vital has forty thousand francs a year from invested
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he stays a hatter!&rdquo; cried the Southerner, with a bound that almost
      broke the arm which Bixiou had linked in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see the man,&rdquo; said Leon. &ldquo;You need a hat and you shall have one
      gratis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Monsieur Vital absent?&rdquo; asked Bixiou, seeing no one behind the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is correcting proof in his study,&rdquo; replied the head clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hein! what style!&rdquo; said Leon to his cousin; then he added, addressing the
      clerk: &ldquo;Could we speak to him without injury to his inspiration?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let those gentlemen enter,&rdquo; said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bourgeois voice, the voice of one eligible to the Chamber, a
      powerful voice, a wealthy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vital deigned to show himself, dressed entirely in black cloth, with a
      splendid frilled shirt adorned with one diamond. The three friends
      observed a young and pretty woman sitting near the desk, working at some
      embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vital is a man between thirty and forty years of age, with a natural
      joviality now repressed by ambitious ideas. He is blessed with that medium
      height which is the privilege of sound organizations. He is rather plump,
      and takes great pains with his person. His forehead is getting bald, but
      he uses that circumstance to give himself the air of a man consumed by
      thought. It is easy to see by the way his wife looks at him and listens to
      him that she believes in the genius and glory of her husband. Vital loves
      artists, not that he has any taste for art, but from fellowship; for he
      feels himself an artist, and makes this felt by disclaiming that title of
      nobility, and placing himself with constant premeditation at so great a
      distance from the arts that persons may be forced to say to him: &ldquo;You have
      raised the construction of hats to the height of a science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you at last discovered a hat to suit me?&rdquo; asked Leon de Lora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, monsieur! in fifteen days?&rdquo; replied Vital, &ldquo;and for you! Two months
      would hardly suffice to invent a shape in keeping with your countenance.
      See, here is your lithographic portrait: I have studied it most carefully.
      I would not give myself that trouble for a prince; but you are more; you
      are an artist, and you understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is one of our greatest inventors,&rdquo; said Bixiou presenting Gazonal.
      &ldquo;He might be as great as Jacquart if he would only let himself die. Our
      friend, a manufacturer of cloth, has discovered a method of replacing the
      indigo in old blue coats, and he wants to see you as another great
      phenomenon, because he has heard of your saying, &lsquo;The hat is the man.&rsquo; 
      That speech of yours enraptured him. Ah! Vital, you have faith; you
      believe in something; you have enthusiasm for your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vital scarcely listened; he grew pale with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, my wife! Monsieur is a man of science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Vital rose at her husband&rsquo;s gesture. Gazonal bowed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I have the honor to cover your head?&rdquo; said Vital, with joyful
      obsequiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same price as mine,&rdquo; interposed Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course; I ask no other fee than to be quoted by you,
      messieurs&mdash;Monsieur needs a picturesque hat, something in the style
      of Monsieur Lousteau&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he continued, looking at Gazonal with the eye of
      a master. &ldquo;I will consider it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give yourself a great deal of trouble,&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! for a few persons only; for those who know how to appreciate the
      value of the pains I bestow upon them. Now, take the aristocracy&mdash;there
      is but one man there who has truly comprehended the Hat; and that is the
      Prince de Bethune. How is it that men do not consider, as women do, that
      the hat is the first thing that strikes the eye? And why have they never
      thought of changing the present system, which is, let us say it frankly,
      ignoble? Yes, ignoble; and yet a Frenchman is, of all nationalities, the
      one most persistent in this folly! I know the difficulties of a change,
      messieurs. I don&rsquo;t speak of my own writings on the matter, which, as I
      think, approach it philosophically, but simply as a hatter. I have myself
      studied means to accentuate the infamous head-covering to which France is
      now enslaved until I succeed in overthrowing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he pointed to the hideous hat in vogue at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the enemy, messieurs,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;How is it that the wittiest
      and most satirical people on earth will consent to wear upon their heads a
      bit of stove-pipe?&mdash;as one of our great writers has called it. Here
      are some of the infections I have been able to give to those atrocious
      lines,&rdquo; he added, pointing to a number of his creations. &ldquo;But, although I
      am able to conform them to the character of each wearer&mdash;for, as you
      see, there are the hats of a doctor, a grocer, a dandy, an artist, a fat
      man, a thin man, and so forth&mdash;the style itself remains horrible.
      Seize, I beg of you, my whole thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up a hat, low-crowned and wide-brimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is the old hat of Claude Vignon, a great critic, in
      the days when he was a free man and a free-liver. He has lately come round
      to the ministry; they&rsquo;ve made him a professor, a librarian; he writes now
      for the Debats only; they&rsquo;ve appointed him Master of Petitions with a
      salary of sixteen thousand francs; he earns four thousand more out of his
      paper, and he is decorated. Well, now see his new hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Vital showed them a hat of a form and design which was truly
      expressive of the juste-milieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have made him a Punch and Judy hat!&rdquo; cried Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man of genius, Monsieur Vital,&rdquo; said Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vital bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you kindly tell me why the shops of your trade in Paris remain open
      late at night,&mdash;later than the cafes and the wineshops? That fact
      puzzles me very much,&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, our shops are much finer when lighted up than they
      are in the daytime; next, where we sell ten hats in the daytime we sell
      fifty at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is queer in Paris,&rdquo; said Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to my efforts and my successes,&rdquo; said Vital, returning to the
      course of his self-laudation, &ldquo;we are coming to hats with round
      headpieces. It is to that I tend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What obstacle is there?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheapness, monsieur. In the first place, very handsome silk hats can be
      built for fifteen francs, which kills our business; for in Paris no one
      ever has fifteen francs in his pocket to spend on a hat. If a beaver hat
      costs thirty, it is still the same thing&mdash;When I say beaver, I ought
      to state that there are not ten pounds of beaver skins left in France.
      That article is worth three hundred and fifty francs a pound, and it takes
      an ounce for a hat. Besides, a beaver hat isn&rsquo;t really worth anything; the
      skin takes a wretched dye; gets rusty in ten minutes under the sun, and
      heat puts it out of shape as well. What we call &lsquo;beaver&rsquo; in the trade is
      neither more nor less than hare&rsquo;s-skin. The best qualities are made from
      the back of the animal, the second from the sides, the third from the
      belly. I confide to you these trade secrets because you are men of honor.
      But whether a man has hare&rsquo;s-skin or silk on his head, fifteen or thirty
      francs in short, the problem is always insoluble. Hats must be paid for in
      cash, and that is why the hat remains what it is. The honor of vestural
      France will be saved on the day that gray hats with round crowns can be
      made to cost a hundred francs. We could then, like the tailors, give
      credit. To reach that result men must resolve to wear buckles, gold lace,
      plumes, and the brims lined with satin, as in the days of Louis XIII. and
      Louis XIV. Our business, which would then enter the domain of fancy, would
      increase tenfold. The markets of the world should belong to France; Paris
      will forever give the tone to women&rsquo;s fashions, and yet the hats which all
      Frenchmen wear to-day are made in every country on earth! There are ten
      millions of foreign money to be gained annually for France in that
      question&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A revolution!&rdquo; cried Bixiou, pretending enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a radical one; for the form must be changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are happy after the manner of Luther in dreaming of reform,&rdquo; said
      Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur. Ah! if a dozen or fifteen artists, capitalists, or dandies
      who set the tone would only have courage for twenty-four hours France
      would gain a splendid commercial battle! To succeed in this reform I would
      give my whole fortune! Yes, my sole ambition is to regenerate the hat and
      disappear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is colossal,&rdquo; said Gazonal, as they left the shop; &ldquo;but I assure
      you that all your originals so far have a touch of the Southerner about
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go this way,&rdquo; said Bixiou pointing to the rue Saint-Marc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to show me something else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you shall see the usuress of rats, marcheuses and great ladies,&mdash;a
      woman who possesses more terrible secrets than there are gowns hanging in
      her window,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he showed Gazonal one of those untidy shops which made an ugly stain
      in the midst of the dazzling show-windows of modern retail commerce. This
      shop had a front painted in 1820, which some bankrupt had doubtless left
      in a dilapidated condition. The color had disappeared beneath a double
      coating of dirt, the result of usage, and a thick layer of dust; the
      window-panes were filthy, the door-knob turned of itself, as door-knobs do
      in all places where people go out more quickly than they enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say of <i>that</i>? First cousin to Death, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said
      Leon in Gazonal&rsquo;s ear, showing him, at the desk, a terrible individual.
      &ldquo;Well, she calls herself Madame Nourrisson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, how much is this guipure?&rdquo; asked the manufacturer, intending to
      compete in liveliness with the two artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you, monsieur, who come from the country, it will be only three
      hundred francs,&rdquo; she replied. Then, remarking in his manner a sort of
      eagerness peculiar to Southerners, she added, in a grieved tone, &ldquo;It
      formerly belonged to that poor Princess de Lamballe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you dare exhibit it so near the palace?&rdquo; cried Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, <i>they</i> don&rsquo;t believe in it,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, we have not come to make purchases,&rdquo; said Bixiou, with a show of
      frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see, monsieur,&rdquo; returned Madame Nourrisson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have several things to sell,&rdquo; said the illustrious caricaturist. &ldquo;I
      live close by, rue de Richelieu, 112, sixth floor. If you will come round
      there for a moment, you may perhaps make some good bargains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Madame Nourrisson did in fact present herself at
      Bixiou&rsquo;s lodgings, where by that time he had taken Leon and Gazonal.
      Madame Nourrisson found them all three as serious as authors whose
      collaboration does not meet with the success it deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said the intrepid hoaxer, showing her a pair of women&rsquo;s
      slippers, &ldquo;these belonged formerly to the Empress Josephine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt it incumbent on him to return change for the Prince de Lamballe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;they were made this year; look at the mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you perceive that the slippers are only by way of preface?&rdquo; said
      Leon; &ldquo;though, to be sure, they are usually the conclusion of a tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend here,&rdquo; said Bixiou, motioning to Gazonal, &ldquo;has an immense
      family interest in ascertaining whether a young lady of a good and wealthy
      house, whom he wishes to marry, has ever gone wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will monsieur give for the information,&rdquo; she asked, looking at
      Gazonal, who was no longer surprised by anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred francs,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo; she said with a grimace of refusal worthy of a macaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then say how much you want, my little Madame Nourrisson,&rdquo; cried Bixiou
      catching her round the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, my dear gentlemen, I have never, since I&rsquo;ve been in
      the business, found man or woman to haggle over happiness. Besides,&rdquo; she
      said, letting a cold smile flicker on her lips, and enforcing it by an icy
      glance full of catlike distrust, &ldquo;if it doesn&rsquo;t concern your happiness, it
      concerns your fortune; and at the height where I find you lodging no man
      haggles over a &lsquo;dot&rsquo;&mdash;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;out with it! What is it you
      want to know, my lambs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the Beunier family,&rdquo; replied Bixiou, very glad to find out
      something in this indirect manner about persons in whom he was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;one louis is quite enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I hold all the mother&rsquo;s jewels and she&rsquo;s on tenter-hooks every
      three months, I can tell you! It is hard work for her to pay the interest
      on what I&rsquo;ve lent her. Do you want to marry there, simpleton?&rdquo; she added,
      addressing Gazonal; &ldquo;then pay me forty francs and I&rsquo;ll talk four hundred
      worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal produced a forty-franc gold-piece, and Madame Nourrisson gave him
      startling details as to the secret penury of certain so-called fashionable
      women. This dealer in cast-off clothes, getting lively as she talked,
      pictured herself unconsciously while telling of others. Without betraying
      a single name or any secret, she made the three men shudder by proving to
      them how little so-called happiness existed in Paris that did not rest on
      the vacillating foundation of borrowed money. She possessed, laid away in
      her drawers, the secrets of departed grandmothers, living children,
      deceased husbands, dead granddaughters,&mdash;memories set in gold and
      diamonds. She learned appalling stories by making her clients talk of one
      another; tearing their secrets from them in moments of passion, of
      quarrels, of anger, and during those cooler negotiations which need a loan
      to settle difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why were you ever induced to take up such a business?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my son&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she said naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such women almost invariably justify their trade by alleging noble
      motives. Madame Nourrisson posed as having lost several opportunities for
      marriage, also three daughters who had gone to the bad, and all her
      illusions. She showed the pawn-tickets of the Mont-de-Piete to prove the
      risks her business ran; declared that she did not know how to meet the
      &ldquo;end of the month&rdquo;; she was robbed, she said,&mdash;<i>robbed</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two artists looked at each other on hearing that expression, which
      seemed exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my sons, I&rsquo;ll show you how we are <i>done</i>. It is not about
      myself, but about my opposite neighbour, Madame Mahuchet, a ladies&rsquo; 
      shoemaker. I had loaned money to a countess, a woman who has too many
      passions for her means,&mdash;lives in a fine apartment filled with
      splendid furniture, and makes, as we say, a devil of a show with her high
      and mighty airs. She owed three hundred francs to her shoemaker, and was
      giving a dinner no later than yesterday. The shoemaker, who heard of the
      dinner from the cook, came to see me; we got excited, and she wanted to
      make a row; but I said: &lsquo;My dear Madame Mahuchet, what good will that do?
      you&rsquo;ll only get yourself hated. It is much better to obtain some security;
      and you save your bile.&rsquo; She wouldn&rsquo;t listen, but go she would, and asked
      me to support her; so I went. &lsquo;Madame is not at home.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Up to that!
      we&rsquo;ll wait,&rsquo; said Madame Mahuchet, &lsquo;if we have to stay all night,&rsquo;&mdash;and
      down we camped in the antechamber. Presently the doors began to open and
      shut, and feet and voices came along. I felt badly. The guests were
      arriving for dinner. You can see the appearance it had. The countess sent
      her maid to coax Madame Mahuchet: &lsquo;Pay you to-morrow!&rsquo; in short, all the
      snares! Nothing took. The countess, dressed to the nines, went to the
      dining-room. Mahuchet heard her and opened the door. Gracious! when she
      saw that table sparkling with silver, the covers to the dishes and the
      chandeliers all glittering like a jewel-case, didn&rsquo;t she go off like
      soda-water and fire her shot: &lsquo;When people spend the money of others they
      should be sober and not give dinner-parties. Think of your being a
      countess and owing three hundred francs to a poor shoemaker with seven
      children!&rsquo; You can guess how she railed, for the Mahuchet hasn&rsquo;t any
      education. When the countess tried to make an excuse (&lsquo;no money&rsquo;) Mahuchet
      screamed out: &lsquo;Look at all your fine silver, madame; pawn it and pay me!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Take
      some yourself,&rsquo; said the countess quickly, gathering up a quantity of
      forks and spoons and putting them into her hands. Downstairs we rattled!&mdash;heavens!
      like success itself. No, before we got to the street Mahuchet began to cry&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      a kind woman! She turned back and restored the silver; for she now
      understood that countess&rsquo; poverty&mdash;it was plated ware!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she forked it over,&rdquo; said Leon, in whom the former Mistigris
      occasionally reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame Nourrisson, enlightened by the slang,
      &ldquo;you are an artist, you write plays, you live in the rue du Helder and are
      friends with Madame Anatolia; you have habits that I know all about. Come,
      do you want some rarity in the grand style,&mdash;Carabine or Mousqueton,
      Malaga or Jenny Cadine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malaga, Carabine! nonsense!&rdquo; cried Leon de Lora. &ldquo;It was we who invented
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, my good Madame Nourrisson,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;that we only
      wanted the pleasure of making your acquaintance, and we should like very
      much to be informed as to how you ever came to slip into this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was confidential maid in the family of a marshal of France, Prince
      d&rsquo;Ysembourg,&rdquo; she said, assuming the airs of a Dorine. &ldquo;One morning, one
      of the most beplumed countesses of the Imperial court came to the house
      and wanted to speak to the marshal privately. I put myself in the way of
      hearing what she said. She burst into tears and confided to that booby of
      a marshal&mdash;yes, the Conde of the Republic is a booby!&mdash;that her
      husband, who served under him in Spain, had left her without means, and if
      she didn&rsquo;t get a thousand francs, or two thousand, that day her children
      must go without food; she hadn&rsquo;t any for the morrow. The marshal, who was
      always ready to give in those days, took two notes of a thousand francs
      each out of his desk, and gave them to her. I saw that fine countess going
      down the staircase where she couldn&rsquo;t see me. She was laughing with a
      satisfaction that certainly wasn&rsquo;t motherly, so I slipped after her to the
      peristyle where I heard her say to the coachman, &lsquo;To Leroy&rsquo;s.&rsquo; I ran round
      quickly to Leroy&rsquo;s, and there, sure enough, was the poor mother. I got
      there in time to see her order and pay for a fifteen-hundred-franc dress;
      you understand that in those days people were made to pay when they
      bought. The next day but one she appeared at an ambassador&rsquo;s ball, dressed
      to please all the world and some one in particular. That day I said to
      myself: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a career! When I&rsquo;m no longer young I&rsquo;ll lend money to
      great ladies on their finery; for passion never calculates, it pays
      blindly.&rsquo; If you want subjects for a vaudeville I can sell you plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She departed after delivering this tirade, in which all the phases of her
      past life were outlined, leaving Gazonal as much horrified by her
      revelations as by the five yellow teeth she showed when she tried to
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; he asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make notes,&rdquo; replied Bixiou, whistling for his porter; &ldquo;for I want some
      money, and I&rsquo;ll show you the use of porters. You think they only pull the
      gate-cord; whereas they really pull poor devils like me and artists whom
      they take under their protection out of difficulties. Mine will get the
      Montyon prize one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal opened his eyes to their utmost roundness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man between two ages, partly a graybeard, partly an office-boy, but more
      oily within and without, hair greasy, stomach puffy, skin dull and moist,
      like that of the prior of a convent, always wearing list shoes, a blue
      coat, and grayish trousers, made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, monsieur?&rdquo; he said with an air which combined that of a
      protector and a subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ravenouillet&mdash;His name is Ravenouillet,&rdquo; said Bixiou turning to
      Gazonal. &ldquo;Have you our notebook of bills due with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ravenouillet pulled out of his pocket the greasiest and stickiest book
      that Gazonal&rsquo;s eyes had ever beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write down at three months&rsquo; sight two notes of five hundred francs each,
      which you will proceed to sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bixiou handed over two notes already drawn to his order by
      Ravenouillet, which Ravenouillet immediately signed and inscribed on the
      greasy book, in which his wife also kept account of the debts of the other
      lodgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Ravenouillet,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a box at the Vaudeville
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my daughter will enjoy that,&rdquo; said Ravenouillet, departing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are seventy-one tenants in this house,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;and the
      average of what they owe Ravenouillet is six thousand francs a month,
      eighteen thousand quarterly for money advanced, postage, etc., not
      counting the rents due. He is Providence&mdash;at thirty per cent, which
      we all pay him, though he never asks for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Paris! Paris!&rdquo; cried Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you now, cousin Gazonal,&rdquo; said Bixiou, after indorsing
      the notes, &ldquo;to see another comedian, who will play you a charming scene
      gratis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A usurer. As we go along I&rsquo;ll tell you the debut of friend Ravenouillet
      in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing in front of the porter&rsquo;s lodge, Gazonal saw Mademoiselle Lucienne
      Ravenouillet holding in her hand a music score (she was a pupil of the
      Conservatoire), her father reading a newspaper, and Madame Ravenouillet
      with a package of letters to be carried up to the lodgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Monsieur Bixiou!&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a rat,&rdquo; explained Leon to his cousin; &ldquo;she is the larva of the
      grasshopper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the history of Ravenouillet,&rdquo; continued Bixiou, when the three
      friends reached the boulevard. &ldquo;In 1831 Massol, the councillor of state
      who is dealing with your case, was a lawyer-journalist who at that time
      never thought of being more than Keeper of the Seals, and deigned to have
      King Louis-Philippe on his throne. Forgive his ambition, he&rsquo;s from
      Carcassonne. One morning there entered to him a young rustic of his parts,
      who said: &lsquo;You know me very well, Mossoo Massol; I&rsquo;m your neighbour the
      grocer&rsquo;s little boy; I&rsquo;ve come from down there, for they tell me a fellow
      is certain to get a place if he comes to Paris.&rsquo; Hearing these words,
      Massol shuddered, and said to himself that if he were weak enough to help
      this compatriot (to him utterly unknown) he should have the whole
      department prone upon him, his bell-rope would break, his valet leave him,
      he should have difficulties with his landlord about the stairway, and the
      other lodgers would assuredly complain of the smell of garlic pervading
      the house. Consequently, he looked at his visitor as a butcher looks at a
      sheep whose throat he intends to cut. But whether the rustic comprehended
      the stab of that glance or not, he went on to say (so Massol told me),
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve as much ambition as other men. I will never go back to my native
      place, if I ever do go back, unless I am a rich man. Paris is the
      antechamber of Paradise. They tell me that you who write the newspapers
      can make, as they say, &lsquo;fine weather and foul&rsquo;; that is, you have things
      all your own way, and it&rsquo;s enough to ask your help to get any place, no
      matter what, under government. Now, though I have faculties, like others,
      I know myself: I have no education; I don&rsquo;t know how to write, and that&rsquo;s
      a misfortune, for I have ideas. I am not seeking, therefore, to be your
      rival; I judge myself, and I know I couldn&rsquo;t succeed there. But, as you
      are so powerful, and as we are almost brothers, having played together in
      childhood, I count upon you to launch me in a career and to protect me&mdash;Oh,
      you <i>must</i>; I want a place, a place suitable to my capacity, to such
      as I am, a place were I can make my fortune.&rsquo; Massol was just about to put
      his compatriot neck and crop out of the door with some brutal speech, when
      the rustic ended his appeal thus: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t ask to enter the administration
      where people advance like tortoises&mdash;there&rsquo;s your cousin, who has
      stuck in one post for twenty years. No, I only want to make my debut.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;On
      the stage?&rsquo; asked Massol only too happy at that conclusion.&mdash;&lsquo;No,
      though I have gesture enough, and figure, and memory. But there&rsquo;s too much
      wear and tear; I prefer the career of <i>porter</i>.&rsquo; Massol kept his
      countenance, and replied: &lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s more wear and tear in that, but
      as your choice is made I&rsquo;ll see what I can do&rsquo;; and he got him, as
      Ravenouillet says, his first &lsquo;cordon.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was the first master,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;to consider the race of porter.
      You&rsquo;ll find knaves of morality, mountebanks of vanity, modern sycophants,
      septembriseurs, disguised in philanthropy, inventors of palpitating
      questions, preaching the emancipation of the negroes, improvement of
      little thieves, benevolence to liberated convicts, and who, nevertheless,
      leave their porters in a condition worse than that of the Irish, in holes
      more dreadful than a mud cabin, and pay them less money to live on than
      the State pays to support a convict. I have done but one good action in my
      life, and that was to build my porter a decent lodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;if a man, having built a great cage divided into
      thousands of compartments like the cells of a beehive or the dens of a
      menagerie, constructed to receive human beings of all trades and all
      kinds, if that animal, calling itself the proprietor, should go to a man
      of science and say: &lsquo;I want an individual of the bimanous species, able to
      live in holes full of old boots, pestiferous with rags, and ten feet
      square; I want him such that he can live there all his life, sleep there,
      eat there, be happy, get children as pretty as little cupids, work, toil,
      cultivate flowers, sing there, stay there, and live in darkness but see
      and know everything,&rsquo; most assuredly the man of science could never have
      invented the porter to oblige the proprietor; Paris, and Paris only could
      create him, or, if you choose, the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parisian creative powers have gone farther than that,&rdquo; said Gazonal;
      &ldquo;look at the workmen! You don&rsquo;t know all the products of industry, though
      you exhibit them. Our toilers fight against the toilers of the continent
      by force of misery, as Napoleon fought Europe by force of regiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are, at my friend the usurer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;His name is
      Vauvinet. One of the greatest mistakes made by writers who describe our
      manners and morals is to harp on old portraits. In these days all trades
      change. The grocer becomes a peer of France, artists capitalize their
      money, vaudevillists have incomes. A few rare beings may remain what they
      originally were, but professions in general have no longer either their
      special costume or their formerly fixed habits and ways. In the past we
      had Gobseck, Gigounet, Samonon,&mdash;the last of the Romans; to-day we
      rejoice in Vauvinet, the good-fellow usurer, the dandy who frequents the
      greenroom and the lorettes, and drives about in a little coupe with one
      horse. Take special note of my man, friend Gazonal, and you&rsquo;ll see the
      comedy of money, the cold man who won&rsquo;t give a penny, the hot man who
      snuffs a profit; listen to him attentively!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three went up to the second floor of a fine-looking house on the
      boulevard des Italiens, where they found themselves surrounded by the
      elegances then in fashion. A young man about twenty-eight years of age
      advanced to meet them with a smiling face, for he saw Leon de Lora first.
      Vauvinet held out his hand with apparent friendliness to Bixiou, and bowed
      coldly to Gazonal as he motioned them to enter his office, where bourgeois
      taste was visible beneath the artistic appearance of the furniture, and in
      spite of the statuettes and the thousand other little trifles applied to
      our little apartments by modern art, which has made itself as small as its
      patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vauvinet was dressed, like other young men of our day who go into
      business, with extreme elegance, which many of them regard as a species of
      prospectus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for some money,&rdquo; said Bixiou, laughing, and presenting his
      notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vauvinet assumed a serious air, which made Gazonal smile, such difference
      was there between the smiling visage that received them and the
      countenance of the money-lender recalled to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Vauvinet, looking at Bixiou, &ldquo;I should certainly
      oblige you with the greatest pleasure, but I haven&rsquo;t any money to loan at
      the present time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have given all I had to&mdash;you know who. That poor Lousteau went
      into partnership for the management of a theatre with an old vaudevillist
      who has great influence with the ministry, Ridal; and they came to me
      yesterday for thirty thousand francs. I&rsquo;m cleaned out, and so completely
      that I was just in the act of sending to Cerizet for a hundred louis, when
      I lost at lansquenet this morning, at Jenny Cadine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must indeed me hard-up if you can&rsquo;t oblige this poor Bixiou,&rdquo; said
      Leon de Lora; &ldquo;for he can be very sharp-tongued when he hasn&rsquo;t a sou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;I could never say anything but good of Vauvinet;
      he&rsquo;s full of goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Vauvinet, &ldquo;if I had the money, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly
      discount, even at fifty per cent, notes which are drawn by your porter.
      Ravenouillet&rsquo;s paper isn&rsquo;t in demand. He&rsquo;s not a Rothschild. I warn you
      that his notes are worn thin; you had better invent another firm. Find an
      uncle. As for a friend who&rsquo;ll sign notes for us there&rsquo;s no such being to
      be found; the matter-of-factness of the present age is making awful
      progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a friend,&rdquo; said Bixiou, motioning to Leon&rsquo;s cousin. &ldquo;Monsieur
      here; one of the most distinguished manufacturers of cloth in the South,
      named Gazonal. His hair is not very well dressed,&rdquo; added Bixiou, looking
      at the touzled and luxuriant crop on the provincial&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;but I am
      going to take him to Marius, who will make him look less like a
      poodle-dog, an appearance so injurious to his credit, and to ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in Southern securities, be it said without offence to
      monsieur,&rdquo; replied Vauvinet, with whom Gazonal was so entertained that he
      did not resent his insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal, that extremely penetrating intellect, thought that the painter
      and Bixiou intended, by way of teaching him to know Paris, to make him pay
      the thousand francs for his breakfast at the Cafe de Paris, for this son
      of the Pyrenees had never got out of that armor of distrust which incloses
      the provincial in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you expect me to have outstanding business at seven hundred miles
      from Paris?&rdquo; added Vauvinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you refuse me positively?&rdquo; asked Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have twenty francs, and no more,&rdquo; said the young usurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you,&rdquo; said the joker. &ldquo;I thought I was worth a thousand
      francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are worth two hundred thousand francs,&rdquo; replied Vauvinet, &ldquo;and
      sometimes you are worth your weight in gold, or at least your tongue is;
      but I tell you I haven&rsquo;t a penny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; replied Bixiou; &ldquo;then we won&rsquo;t say anything more about it. I
      had arranged for this evening, at Carabine&rsquo;s, the thing you most wanted&mdash;you
      know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vauvinet winked an eye at Bixiou; the wink that two jockeys give each
      other when they want to say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try trickery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember catching me round the waist as if I were a pretty
      woman,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;and coaxing me with look and speech, and saying,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything for you if you&rsquo;ll only get me shares at par in that
      railroad du Tillet and Nucingen have made an offer for?&rsquo; Well, old fellow,
      du Tillet and Nucingen are coming to Carabine&rsquo;s to-night, where they will
      meet a number of political characters. You&rsquo;ve lost a fine opportunity.
      Good-bye to you, old carrot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bixiou rose, leaving Vauvinet apparently indifferent, but inwardly annoyed
      by the sense that he had committed a folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said the money-lender. &ldquo;Though I haven&rsquo;t the
      money, I have credit. If your notes are worth nothing, I can keep them and
      give you notes in exchange. If we can come to an agreement about that
      railway stock we could share the profits, of course in due proportion and
      I&rsquo;ll allow you that on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;I want money in hand, and I must get those notes
      of Ravenouillet&rsquo;s cashed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ravenouillet is sound,&rdquo; said Vauvinet. &ldquo;He puts money into the
      savings-bank; he is good security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than you,&rdquo; interposed Leon, &ldquo;for HE doesn&rsquo;t stipend lorettes; he
      hasn&rsquo;t any rent to pay; and he never rushes into speculations which keep
      him dreading either a rise or fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you can laugh at me, great man,&rdquo; returned Vauvinet, once more
      jovial and caressing; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve turned La Fontaine&rsquo;s fable of &lsquo;Le Chene et
      le Roseau&rsquo; into an elixir&mdash;Come, Gubetta, my old accomplice,&rdquo; he
      continued, seizing Bixiou round the waist, &ldquo;you want money; well, I can
      borrow three thousand francs from my friend Cerizet instead of two; &lsquo;Let
      us be friends, Cinna!&rsquo; hand over your colossal cabbages,&mdash;made to
      trick the public like a gardener&rsquo;s catalogue. If I refused you it was
      because it is pretty hard on a man who can only do his poor little
      business by turning over his money, to have to keep your Ravenouillet
      notes in the drawer of his desk. Hard, hard, very hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What discount do you want?&rdquo; asked Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next to nothing,&rdquo; returned Vauvinet. &ldquo;It will cost you a miserable fifty
      francs at the end of the quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Emile Blondet used to say, you shall be my benefactor,&rdquo; replied
      Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty per cent!&rdquo; whispered Gazonal to Bixiou, who replied by a punch of
      his elbow in the provincial&rsquo;s oesophagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; said Vauvinet opening a drawer in his desk as if to put away
      the Ravenouillet notes, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s an old bill of five hundred francs stuck
      in the drawer! I didn&rsquo;t know I was so rich. And here&rsquo;s a note payable at
      the end of the month for four hundred and fifty; Cerizet will take it
      without much diminution, and there&rsquo;s your sum in hand. But no nonsense,
      Bixiou! Hein? to-night, at Carabine&rsquo;s, will you swear to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we <i>re</i>-friended?&rdquo; said Bixiou, pocketing the
      five-hundred-franc bill and the note for four hundred and fifty. &ldquo;I give
      you my word of honor that you shall see du Tillet, and many other men who
      want to make their way&mdash;their railway&mdash;to-night at Carabine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vauvinet conducted the three friends to the landing of the staircase,
      cajoling Bixiou on the way. Bixiou kept a grave face till he reached the
      outer door, listening to Gazonal, who tried to enlighten him on his late
      operation, and to prove to him that if Vauvinet&rsquo;s follower, Cerizet, took
      another twenty francs out of his four hundred and fifty, he was getting
      money at forty per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the asphalt Bixiou frightened Gazonal by the laugh of a
      Parisian hoaxer,&mdash;that cold, mute laugh, a sort of labial north wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The assignment of the contract for that railway is adjourned, positively,
      by the Chamber; I heard this yesterday from that marcheuse whom we smiled
      at just now. If I win five or six thousand francs at lansquenet to-night,
      why should I grudge sixty-five francs for the power to stake, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lansquenet is another of the thousand facets of Paris as it is,&rdquo; said
      Leon. &ldquo;And therefore, cousin, I intend to present you to-night in the
      salon of a duchess,&mdash;a duchess of the rue Saint-Georges, where you
      will see the aristocracy of the lorettes, and probably be able to win your
      lawsuit. But it is quite impossible to present you anywhere with that mop
      of Pyrenean hair; you look like a porcupine; and therefore we&rsquo;ll take you
      close by, Place de la Bourse, to Marius, another of our comedians&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you his tale,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;In the year 1800 a Toulousian
      named Cabot, a young wig-maker devoured by ambition, came to Paris, and
      set up a shop (I use your slang). This man of genius,&mdash;he now has an
      income of twenty-four thousand francs a year, and lives, retired from
      business, at Libourne,&mdash;well, he saw that so vulgar and ignoble a
      name as Cabot could never attain celebrity. Monsieur de Parny, whose hair
      he cut, gave him the name of Marius, infinitely superior, you perceive, to
      the Christian names of Armand and Hippolyte, behind which patronymics
      attacked by the Cabot evil are wont to hide. All the successors of Cabot
      have called themselves Marius. The present Marius is Marius V.; his real
      name is Mongin. This occurs in various other trades; for &lsquo;Botot water,&rsquo; 
      and for &lsquo;Little-Virtue&rsquo; ink. Names become commercial property in Paris,
      and have ended by constituting a sort of ensign of nobility. The present
      Marius, who takes pupils, has created, he says, the leading school of
      hair-dressing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen, in coming through France,&rdquo; said Gazonal, &ldquo;a great many signs
      bearing the words: &lsquo;Such a one, pupil of Marius.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His pupils have to wash their hands after every head,&rdquo; said Bixiou; &ldquo;but
      Marius does not take them indifferently; they must have nice hands, and
      not be ill-looking. The most remarkable for manners, appearance, and
      elocution are sent out to dress heads; and they come back tired to death.
      Marius himself never turns out except for titled women; he drives his
      cabriolet and has a groom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, after all, he is nothing but a barber!&rdquo; cried Gazonal, somewhat
      shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barber!&rdquo; exclaimed Bixiou; &ldquo;please remember that he is captain in the
      National Guard, and is decorated for being the first to spring into a
      barricade in 1832.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And take care what you say to him: he is neither barber, hair-dresser,
      nor wig-maker; he is a director of salons for hair-dressing,&rdquo; said Leon,
      as they went up a staircase with crystal balusters and mahogany rail, the
      steps of which were covered with a sumptuous carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! mind you don&rsquo;t compromise us,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;In the antechamber
      you&rsquo;ll see lacqueys who will take off your coat, and seize your hat, to
      brush them; and they&rsquo;ll accompany you to the door of the salons to open
      and shut it. I mention this, friend Gazonal,&rdquo; added Bixiou, slyly, &ldquo;lest
      you might think they were after your property, and cry &lsquo;Stop thief!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These salons,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;are three boudoirs where the director has
      collected all the inventions of modern luxury: lambrequins to the windows,
      jardinieres everywhere, downy divans where each customer can wait his turn
      and read the newspapers. You might suppose, when you first go in, that
      five francs would be the least they&rsquo;d get out of your waistcoat pocket;
      but nothing is ever extracted beyond ten sous for combing and frizzing
      your hair, or twenty sous for cutting and frizzing. Elegant
      dressing-tables stand about among the jardinieres; water is laid on to the
      washstands; enormous mirrors reproduce the whole figure. Therefore don&rsquo;t
      look astonished. When the client (that&rsquo;s the elegant word substituted by
      Marius for the ignoble word customer),&mdash;when the client appears at
      the door, Marius gives him a glance which appraises him: to Marius you are
      a <i>head</i>, more or less susceptible of occupying his mind. To him
      there&rsquo;s no mankind; there are only heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We let you hear Marius on all the notes of his scale,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;and
      you know how to follow our lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Gazonal showed himself, the glance was given, and was evidently
      favourable, for Marius exclaimed: &ldquo;Regulus! yours this head! Prepare it
      first with the little scissors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Gazonal to the pupil, at a sign from Bixiou. &ldquo;I prefer
      to have my head dressed by Monsieur Marius himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marius, much flattered by this demand, advanced, leaving the head on which
      he was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am with you in a moment; I am just finishing. Pray have no uneasiness,
      my pupil will prepare you; I alone will decide the cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marius, a slim little man, his hair frizzed like that of Rubini, and jet
      black, dressed also in black, with long white cuffs, and the frill of his
      shirt adorned with a diamond, now saw Bixiou, to whom he bowed as to a
      power the equal of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is only an ordinary head,&rdquo; he said to Leon, pointing to the person
      on whom he was operating,&mdash;&ldquo;a grocer, or something of that kind. But
      if we devoted ourselves to art only, we should lie in Bicetre, mad!&rdquo; and
      he turned back with an inimitable gesture to his client, after saying to
      Regulus, &ldquo;Prepare monsieur, he is evidently an artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A journalist,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that word, Marius gave two or three strokes of the comb to the
      ordinary head and flung himself upon Gazonal, taking Regulus by the arm at
      the instant that the pupil was about to begin the operation of the little
      scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take charge of monsieur. Look, monsieur,&rdquo; he said to the grocer,
      &ldquo;reflect yourself in the great mirror&mdash;if the mirror permits.
      Ossian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lacquey entered, and took hold of the client to dress him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pay at the desk, monsieur,&rdquo; said Marius to the stupefied grocer, who
      was pulling out his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any use, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;in going through this
      operation of the little scissors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No head ever comes to me uncleansed,&rdquo; replied the illustrious
      hair-dresser; &ldquo;but for your sake, I will do that of monsieur myself,
      wholly. My pupils sketch out the scheme, or my strength would not hold
      out. Every one says as you do: &lsquo;Dressed by Marius!&rsquo; Therefore, I can give
      only the finishing strokes. What journal is monsieur on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were you, I should keep three or four Mariuses,&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! monsieur, I see, is a feuilletonist,&rdquo; said Marius. &ldquo;Alas! in dressing
      heads which expose us to notice it is impossible. Excuse me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left Gazonal to overlook Regulus, who was &ldquo;preparing&rdquo; a newly arrived
      head. Tapping his tongue against his palate, he made a disapproving noise,
      which may perhaps be written down as &ldquo;titt, titt, titt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there! good heavens! that cut is not square; your scissors are
      hacking it. Here! see there! Regulus, you are not clipping poodles; these
      are men&mdash;who have a character; if you continue to look at the ceiling
      instead of looking only between the glass and the head, you will dishonor
      my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are stern, Monsieur Marius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe them the secrets of my art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is an art?&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marius, affronted, looked at Gazonal in the glass, and stopped short, the
      scissors in one hand, the comb in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, you speak like a&mdash;child! and yet, from your accent, I
      judge you are from the South, the birthplace of men of genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that hair-dressing requires some taste,&rdquo; replied Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, monsieur, hush! I expected better things of YOU. Let me tell you
      that a hair-dresser,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say a good hair-dresser, for a man is,
      or he is not, a hair-dresser,&mdash;a hair-dresser, I repeat, is more
      difficult to find than&mdash;what shall I say? than&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
      what&mdash;a minister?&mdash;(Sit still!) No, for you can&rsquo;t judge by
      ministers, the streets are full of them. A Paganini? No, he&rsquo;s not great
      enough. A hair-dresser, monsieur, a man who divines your soul and your
      habits, in order to dress your hair conformably with your being, that man
      has all that constitutes a philosopher&mdash;and such he is. See the
      women! Women appreciate us; they know our value; our value to them is the
      conquest they make when they have placed their heads in our hands to
      attain a triumph. I say to you that a hair-dresser&mdash;the world does
      not know what he is. I who speak to you, I am very nearly all that there
      is of&mdash;without boasting I may say I am known&mdash;Still, I think
      more might be done&mdash;The execution, that is everything! Ah! if women
      would only give me carte blanche!&mdash;if I might only execute the ideas
      that come to me! I have, you see, a hell of imagination!&mdash;but the
      women don&rsquo;t fall in with it; they have their own plans; they&rsquo;ll stick
      their fingers or combs, as soon as my back is turned, through the most
      delicious edifices&mdash;which ought to be engraved and perpetuated; for
      our works, monsieur, last unfortunately but a few hours. A great
      hair-dresser, hey! he&rsquo;s like Careme and Vestris in their careers. (Head a
      little this way, if you please, SO; I attend particularly to front faces!)
      Our profession is ruined by bunglers who understand neither the epoch nor
      their art. There are dealers in wigs and essences who are enough to make
      one&rsquo;s hair stand on end; they care only to sell you bottles. It is
      pitiable! But that&rsquo;s business. Such poor wretches cut hair and dress it as
      they can. I, when I arrived in Paris from Toulouse, my ambition was to
      succeed the great Marius, to be a true Marius, to make that name
      illustrious. I alone, more than all the four others, I said to myself, &lsquo;I
      will conquer, or die.&rsquo; (There! now sit straight, I am going to finish
      you.) I was the first to introduce <i>elegance</i>; I made my salons the
      object of curiosity. I disdain advertisements; what advertisements would
      have cost, monsieur, I put into elegance, charm, comfort. Next year I
      shall have a quartette in one of the salons to discourse music, and of the
      best. Yes, we ought to charm away the ennui of those whose heads we dress.
      I do not conceal from myself the annoyances to a client. (Look at
      yourself!) To have one&rsquo;s hair dressed is fatiguing, perhaps as much so as
      posing for one&rsquo;s portrait. Monsieur knows perhaps that the famous Monsieur
      Humbolt (I did the best I could with the few hairs America left him&mdash;science
      has this in common with savages, that she scalps her men clean), that
      illustrious savant, said that next to the suffering of going to be hanged
      was that of going to be painted; but I place the trial of having your head
      dressed before that of being painted, and so do certain women. Well,
      monsieur, my object is to make those who come here to have their hair cut
      or frizzed enjoy themselves. (Hold still, you have a tuft which <i>must</i>
      be conquered.) A Jew proposed to supply me with Italian cantatrices who,
      during the interludes, were to depilate the young men of forty; but they
      proved to be girls from the Conservatoire, and music-teachers from the Rue
      Montmartre. There you are, monsieur; your head is dressed as that of a man
      of talent ought to be. Ossian,&rdquo; he said to the lacquey in livery, &ldquo;dress
      monsieur and show him out. Whose turn next?&rdquo; he added proudly, gazing
      round upon the persons who awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, Gazonal,&rdquo; said Leon as they reached the foot of the
      staircase, whence his eye could take in the whole of the Place de la
      Bourse. &ldquo;I see over there one of our great men, and you shall compare his
      language with that of the barber, and tell me which of the two you think
      the most original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, Gazonal,&rdquo; said Bixiou, mimicking Leon&rsquo;s intonation. &ldquo;What do
      you suppose is Marius&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hair-dressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has obtained a monopoly of the sale of hair in bulk, as a certain
      dealer in comestibles who is going to sell us a pate for three francs has
      acquired a monopoly of the sale of truffles; he discounts the paper of
      that business; he loans money on pawn to clients when embarrassed; he
      gives annuities on lives; he gambles at the Bourse; he is a stockholder in
      all the fashion papers; and he sells, under the name of a certain chemist,
      an infamous drug which, for his share alone, gives him an income of thirty
      thousand francs, and costs in advertisements a hundred thousand yearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo; cried Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember this,&rdquo; said Bixiou, gravely. &ldquo;In Paris there is no such thing as
      a small business; all things swell to large proportions, down to the sale
      of rags and matches. The lemonade-seller who, with his napkin under his
      arm, meets you as you enter his shop, may be worth his fifty thousand
      francs a year; the waiter in a restaurant is eligible for the Chamber; the
      man you take for a beggar in the street carries a hundred thousand francs
      worth of unset diamonds in his waistcoat pocket, and didn&rsquo;t steal them
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three inseparables (for one day at any rate) now crossed the Place de
      la Bourse in a way to intercept a man about forty years of age, wearing
      the Legion of honor, who was coming from the boulevard by way of the rue
      Neuve-Vivienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;what are you pondering over, my dear Dubourdieu? Some
      fine symbolic composition? My dear cousin, I have the pleasure to present
      to you our illustrious painter Dubourdieu, not less celebrated for his
      humanitarian convictions than for his talents in art. Dubourdieu, my
      cousin Palafox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dubourdieu, a small, pale man with melancholy blue eyes, bowed slightly to
      Gazonal, who bent low as before a man of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have elected Stidmann in place of&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I help it? I wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; replied Lora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bring the Academy into disrepute,&rdquo; continued the painter. &ldquo;To choose
      such a man as that! I don&rsquo;t wish to say ill of him, but he works at a
      trade. Where are you dragging the first of arts,&mdash;the art those works
      are the most lasting; bringing nations to light of which the world has
      long lost even the memory; an art which crowns and consecrates great men?
      Yes, sculpture is priesthood; it preserves the ideas of an epoch, and you
      give its chair to a maker of toys and mantelpieces, an ornamentationist, a
      seller of bric-a-brac! Ah! as Chamfort said, one has to swallow a viper
      every morning to endure the life of Paris. Well, at any rate, Art remains
      to a few of us; they can&rsquo;t prevent us from cultivating it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides, my dear fellow, you have a consolation which few artists
      possess; the future is yours,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;When the world is converted
      to our doctrine, you will be at the head of your art; for you are putting
      into it ideas which people will understand&mdash;<i>when</i> they are
      generalized! In fifty years from now you&rsquo;ll be to all the world what you
      are to a few of us at this moment,&mdash;a great man. The only question is
      how to get along till then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just finished,&rdquo; resumed the great artist, his face expanding like
      that of a man whose hobby is stroked, &ldquo;an allegorical figure of Harmony;
      and if you will come and see it, you will understand why it should have
      taken me two years to paint it. Everything is in it! At the first glance
      one divines the destiny of the globe. A queen holds a shepherd&rsquo;s crook in
      her hand,&mdash;symbolical of the advancement of the races useful to
      mankind; she wears on her head the cap of Liberty; her breasts are
      sixfold, as the Egyptians carved them&mdash;for the Egyptians foresaw
      Fourier; her feet are resting on two clasped hands which embrace a globe,&mdash;symbol
      of the brotherhood of all human races; she tramples cannon under foot to
      signify the abolition of war; and I have tried to make her face express
      the serenity of triumphant agriculture. I have also placed beside her an
      enormous curled cabbage, which, according to our master, is an image of
      Harmony. Ah! it is not the least among Fourier&rsquo;s titles to veneration that
      he has restored the gift of thought to plants; he has bound all creation
      in one by the signification of things to one another, and by their special
      language. A hundred years hence this earth will be much larger than it is
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how will that, monsieur, come to pass?&rdquo; said Gazonal, stupefied at
      hearing a man outside of a lunatic asylum talk in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the extending of production. If men will apply The System, it
      will not be impossible to act upon the stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would become of painting in that case?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be magnified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would our eyes be magnified too?&rdquo; said Gazonal, looking at his two
      friends significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man will return to what he was before he became degenerate; our six-feet
      men will then be dwarfs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your picture finished?&rdquo; asked Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely finished,&rdquo; replied Dubourdieu. &ldquo;I have tried to see Hiclar, and
      get him to compose a symphony for it; I wish that while viewing my picture
      the public should hear music a la Beethoven to develop its ideas and bring
      them within range of the intellect by two arts. Ah! if the government
      would only lend me one of the galleries of the Louvre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention it, if you want me to do so; you should never neglect an
      opportunity to strike minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my friends are preparing articles; but I am afraid they&rsquo;ll go too
      far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t go as far as the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dubourdieu looked askance at Bixiou, and continued his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; said Gazonal; &ldquo;he is following the moon in her courses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His skill is masterly,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;and he knows his art, but Fourierism
      has killed him. You have just seen, cousin, one of the effects of ambition
      upon artists. Too often, in Paris, from a desire to reach more rapidly
      than by natural ways the celebrity which to them is fortune, artists
      borrow the wings of circumstance, they think they make themselves of more
      importance as men of a specialty, the supporters of some &lsquo;system&rsquo;; and
      they fancy they can transform a clique into the public. One is a
      republican, another Saint-Simonian; this one aristocrat, that one
      Catholic, others juste-milieu, middle ages, or German, as they choose for
      their purpose. Now, though opinions do not give talent, they always spoil
      what talent there is; and the poor fellow whom you have just seen is a
      proof thereof. An artist&rsquo;s opinion ought to be: Faith in his art, in his
      work; and his only way of success is toil when nature has given him the
      sacred fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get away,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;Leon is beginning to moralize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that man was sincere,&rdquo; said Gazonal, still stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly sincere,&rdquo; replied Bixiou; &ldquo;as sincere as the king of barbers
      just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is mad!&rdquo; repeated Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is not the first man driven man by Fourier&rsquo;s ideas,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything about Paris. Ask it for a hundred thousand francs
      to realize an idea that will be useful to humanity,&mdash;the steam-engine
      for instance,&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll die, like Salomon de Caux, at Bicetre; but
      if the money is wanted for some paradoxical absurdity, Parisians will
      annihilate themselves and their fortune for it. It is the same with
      systems as it is with material things. Utterly impracticable newspapers
      have consumed millions within the last fifteen years. What makes your
      lawsuit so hard to win, is that you have right on your side, and on that
      of the prefect there are (so you suppose) secret motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that a man of intellect having once understood the nature of
      Paris could live elsewhere?&rdquo; said Leon to his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we take Gazonal to old Mere Fontaine?&rdquo; said Bixiou, making a sign
      to the driver of a citadine to draw up; &ldquo;it will be a step from the real
      to the fantastic. Driver, Vieille rue du Temple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all three were presently rolling in the direction of the Marais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you taking me to see now?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proof of what Bixiou told you,&rdquo; replied Leon; &ldquo;we shall show you a
      woman who makes twenty thousand francs a year by working a fantastic
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortune-teller,&rdquo; said Bixiou, interpreting the look of the Southerner
      as a question. &ldquo;Madame Fontaine is thought, by those who seek to pry into
      the future, to be wiser in her wisdom than Mademoiselle Lenormand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be very rich,&rdquo; remarked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was the victim of her own idea, as long as lotteries existed,&rdquo; said
      Bixiou; &ldquo;for in Paris there are no great gains without corresponding
      outlays. The strongest heads are liable to crack there, as if to give vent
      to their steam. Those who make much money have vices or fancies,&mdash;no
      doubt to establish an equilibrium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that the lottery is abolished?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! now she has a nephew for whom she is hoarding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the Vieille rue du Temple the three friends entered one
      of the oldest houses in that street and passed up a shaking staircase, the
      steps of which, caked with mud, led them in semi-darkness, and through a
      stench peculiar to houses on an alley, to the third story, where they
      beheld a door which painting alone could render; literature would have to
      spend too many nights in suitably describing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old woman, in keeping with that door, and who might have been that door
      in human guise, ushered the three friends into a room which served as an
      ante-chamber, where, in spite of the warm atmosphere which fills the
      streets of Paris, they felt the icy chill of crypts about them. A damp air
      came from an inner courtyard which resembled a huge air-shaft; the light
      that entered was gray, and the sill of the window was filled with pots of
      sickly plants. In this room, which had a coating of some greasy,
      fuliginous substance, the furniture, the chairs, the table, were all most
      abject. The floor tiles oozed like a water-cooler. In short, every
      accessory was in keeping with the fearful old woman of the hooked nose,
      ghastly face, and decent rags who directed the &ldquo;consulters&rdquo; to sit down,
      informing them that only one at a time could be admitted to Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal, who played the intrepid, entered bravely, and found himself in
      presence of one of those women forgotten by Death, who no doubt forgets
      them intentionally in order to leave some samples of Itself among the
      living. He saw before him a withered face in which shone fixed gray eyes
      of wearying immobility; a flattened nose, smeared with snuff;
      knuckle-bones well set up by muscles that, under pretence of being hands,
      played nonchalantly with a pack of cards, like some machine the movement
      of which is about to run down. The body, a species of broom-handle
      decently covered with clothes, enjoyed the advantages of death and did not
      stir. Above the forehead rose a coif of black velvet. Madame Fontaine, for
      it was really a woman, had a black hen on her right hand and a huge toad,
      named Astaroth, on her left. Gazonal did not at first perceive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toad, of surprising dimensions, was less alarming in himself than
      through the effect of two topaz eyes, large as a ten-sous piece, which
      cast forth vivid gleams. It was impossible to endure that look. The toad
      is a creature as yet unexplained. Perhaps the whole animal creation,
      including man, is comprised in it; for, as Lassailly said, the toad exists
      indefinitely; and, as we know, it is of all created animals the one whose
      marriage lasts the longest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black hen had a cage about two feet distant from the table, covered
      with a green cloth, to which she came along a plank which formed a sort of
      drawbridge between the cage and the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the woman, the least real of the creatures in this Hoffmanesque den,
      said to Gazonal: &ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; the worthy provincial shuddered involuntarily.
      That which renders these beings so formidable is the importance of what we
      want to know. People go to them, as they know very well, to buy hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The den of the sibyl was much darker than the antechamber; the color of
      the walls could scarcely be distinguished. The ceiling, blackened by
      smoke, far from reflecting the little light that came from a window
      obstructed by pale and sickly vegetations, absorbed the greater part of
      it; but the table where the sorceress sat received what there was of this
      half-light fully. The table, the chair of the woman, and that on which
      Gazonal was seated, formed the entire furniture of the little room, which
      was divided at one end by a sort of loft where Madame Fontaine probably
      slept. Gazonal heard through a half-opened door the bubbling murmur of a
      soup-pot. That kitchen sound, accompanied by a composite odor in which the
      effluvia of a sink predominated, mingled incongruous ideas of the
      necessities of actual life with those of supernatural power. Disgust
      entered into curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal observed one stair of pine wood, the lowest no doubt of the
      staircase which led to the loft. He took in these minor details at a
      glance, with a sense of nausea. It was all quite otherwise alarming than
      the romantic tales and scenes of German drama lead one to expect; here was
      suffocating actuality. The air diffused a sort of dizzy heaviness, the dim
      light rasped the nerves. When the Southerner, impelled by a species of
      self-assertion, gazed firmly at the toad, he felt a sort of emetic heat at
      the pit of his stomach, and was conscious of a terror like that a criminal
      might feel in presence of a gendarme. He endeavoured to brace himself by
      looking at Madame Fontaine; but there he encountered two almost white
      eyes, the motionless and icy pupils of which were absolutely intolerable
      to him. The silence became terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you wish, monsieur, the five-franc fortune, the ten-franc
      fortune, or the grand game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The five-franc fortune is dear enough,&rdquo; replied the Southerner, making
      powerful efforts not to yield to the influence of the surroundings in
      which he found himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Gazonal was thus endeavouring to collect himself, a
      voice&mdash;an infernal voice&mdash;made him bound in his chair; the black
      hen clucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back, my daughter, go back; monsieur chooses to spend only five
      francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hen seemed to understand her mistress, for, after coming within a foot
      of the cards, she turned and resumed her former place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What flower to you like best?&rdquo; asked the old woman, in a voice hoarsened
      by the phlegm which seemed to rise and fall incessantly in her bronchial
      tubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What color are you fond of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What animal do you prefer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse. Why these questions?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man derives his form from his anterior states,&rdquo; she said sententiously.
      &ldquo;Hence his instincts; and his instincts rule his destiny. What food do you
      like best to eat,&mdash;fish, game, cereals, butcher&rsquo;s meat, sweet things,
      vegetables, or fruits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what month where you born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put out your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Fontaine looked attentively at the lines of the hand that was shown
      to her. It was all done seriously, with no pretence of sorcery; on the
      contrary, with the simplicity a notary might have shown when asking the
      intentions of a client about a deed. Presently she shuffled the cards, and
      asked Gazonal to cut them, and then to make three packs of them himself.
      After which she took the packs, spread them out before her, and examined
      them as a gambler examines the thirty-six numbers at roulette before he
      risks his stake. Gazonal&rsquo;s bones were freezing; he seemed not to know
      where he was; but his amazement grew greater and greater when this hideous
      old woman in a green bonnet, stout and squat, whose false front was
      frizzed into points of interrogation, proceeded, in a thick voice, to
      relate to him all the particular circumstances, even the most secret, of
      his past life: she told him his tastes, his habits, his character; the
      thoughts of his childhood; everything that had influenced his life; a
      marriage broken off, why, with whom, the exact description of the woman he
      had loved; and, finally, the place he came from, his lawsuit, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal at first thought it was a hoax prepared by his companions; but the
      absolute impossibility of such a conspiracy appeared to him almost as soon
      as the idea itself, and he sat speechless before that truly infernal
      power, the incarnation of which borrowed from humanity a form which the
      imagination of painters and poets has throughout all ages regarded as the
      most awful of created things,&mdash;namely, a toothless, hideous, wheezing
      hag, with cold lips, flattened nose, and whitish eyes. The pupils of those
      eyes had brightened, through them rushed a ray,&mdash;was it from the
      depths of the future or from hell?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal asked, interrupting the old creature, of what use the toad and the
      hen were to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They predict the future. The consulter himself throws grain upon the
      cards; Bilouche comes and pecks it. Astaroth crawls over the cards to get
      the food the client holds for him, and those two wonderful intelligences
      are never mistaken. Will you see them at work?&mdash;you will then know
      your future. The cost is a hundred francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal, horrified by the gaze of Astaroth, rushed into the antechamber,
      after bowing to the terrible old woman. He was moist from head to foot, as
      if under the incubation of some evil spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get away!&rdquo; he said to the two artists. &ldquo;Did you ever consult that
      sorceress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never do anything important without getting Astaroth&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; said
      Leon, &ldquo;and I am always the better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting the virtuous fortune which Bilouche has promised me,&rdquo; said
      Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a fever,&rdquo; cried Gazonal. &ldquo;If I believed what you say I should have
      to believe in sorcery, in some supernatural power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be only natural,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;One-third of all the lorettes,
      one-fourth of all the statesmen, and one-half of all artists consult
      Madame Fontaine; and I know a minister to whom she is an Egeria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she tell you about your future?&rdquo; asked Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I had enough of her about my past. But,&rdquo; added Gazonal, struck by a
      sudden thought, &ldquo;if she can, by the help of those dreadful collaborators,
      predict the future, how came she to lose in the lottery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you put your finger on one of the greatest mysteries of occult
      science,&rdquo; replied Leon. &ldquo;The moment that the species of inward mirror on
      which the past or the future is reflected to their minds become clouded by
      the breath of a personal feeling, by an idea foreign to the purpose of the
      power they are exerting, sorcerers and sorceresses can see nothing; just
      as an artist who blurs art with political combinations and systems loses
      his genius. Not long ago, a man endowed with the gift of divining by
      cards, a rival to Madame Fontaine, became addicted to vicious practices,
      and being unable to tell his own fate from the cards, was arrested, tried,
      and condemned at the court of assizes. Madame Fontaine, who predicts the
      future eight times out of ten, was never able to know if she would win or
      lose in a lottery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same thing in magnetism,&rdquo; remarked Bixiou. &ldquo;A man can&rsquo;t
      magnetize himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! now we come to magnetism!&rdquo; cried Gazonal. &ldquo;Ah ca! do you know
      everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend Gazonal,&rdquo; replied Bixiou, gravely, &ldquo;to be able to laugh at
      everything one must know everything. As for me, I&rsquo;ve been in Paris since
      my childhood; I&rsquo;ve lived, by means of my pencil, on its follies and
      absurdities, at the rate of five caricatures a month. Consequently, I
      often laugh at ideas in which I have faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us get to something else,&rdquo; said Leon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the Chamber
      and settle the cousin&rsquo;s affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Bixiou, imitating Odry in &ldquo;Les Funambules,&rdquo; &ldquo;is high comedy,
      for we will make the first orator we meet pose for us, and you shall see
      that in those halls of legislation, as elsewhere, the Parisian language
      has but two tones,&mdash;Self-interest, Vanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they got into their citadine, Leon saw in a rapidly driven cabriolet a
      man to whom he made a sign that he had something to say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Publicola Masson,&rdquo; said Leon to Bixiou. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask for a
      sitting this evening at five o&rsquo;clock, after the Chamber. The cousin shall
      then see the most curious of all the originals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Gazonal, while Leon went to speak to Publicola Masson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An artist-pedicure,&rdquo; replied Bixiou, &ldquo;author of a &lsquo;Treatise on
      Corporistics,&rsquo; who cuts your corns by subscription, and who, if the
      Republications triumph for six months, will assuredly become immortal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drives his carriage!&rdquo; ejaculated Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my good Gazonal, it is only millionaires who have time to go afoot
      in Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Chamber!&rdquo; cried Leon to the coachman, getting back into the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deputies,&rdquo; replied Leon, exchanging a smile with Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris begins to confound me,&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make you see its immensity,&mdash;moral, political, and literary,&mdash;we
      are now proceeding like the Roman cicerone, who shows you in Saint Peter&rsquo;s
      the thumb of the statue you took to be life-size, and the thumb proves to
      be a foot long. You haven&rsquo;t yet measured so much as a great toe of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remark, cousin Gazonal, that we take things as they come; we haven&rsquo;t
      selected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening you shall sup as they feasted at Belshazzar&rsquo;s; and there you
      shall see our Paris, our own particular Paris, playing lansquenet, and
      risking a hundred thousand francs at a throw without winking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later the citadine stopped at the foot of the steps
      going up to the Chamber of Deputies, at that end of the Pont de la
      Concorde which leads to discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the Chamber unapproachable?&rdquo; said the provincial, surprised to
      find himself in the great lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; replied Bixiou; &ldquo;materially speaking, it costs thirty sous
      for a citadine to approach it; politically, you have to spend rather more.
      The swallows thought, so a poet says, that the Arc de Triomphe was erected
      for them; we artists think that this public building was built for us,&mdash;to
      compensate for the stupidities of the Theatre-Francais and make us laugh;
      but the comedians on this stage are much more expensive; and they don&rsquo;t
      give us every day the value of our money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is the Chamber!&rdquo; cried Gazonal, as he paced the great hall in
      which there were then about a dozen persons, and looked around him with an
      air which Bixiou noted down in his memory and reproduced in one of the
      famous caricatures with which he rivalled Gavarni.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leon went to speak to one of the ushers who go and come continually
      between this hall and the hall of sessions, with which it communicates by
      a passage in which are stationed the stenographers of the &ldquo;Moniteur&rdquo; and
      persons attached to the Chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the minister,&rdquo; replied the usher to Leon as Gazonal approached
      them, &ldquo;he is there, but I don&rsquo;t know if Monsieur Giraud has come. I&rsquo;ll
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the usher opened one side of the double door through which none but
      deputies, ministers, or messengers from the king are allowed to pass,
      Gazonal saw a man come out who seemed still young, although he was really
      forty-eight years old, and to whom the usher evidently indicated Leon de
      Lora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you here!&rdquo; he exclaimed, shaking hands with both Bixiou and Lora.
      &ldquo;Scamps! what are you doing in the sanctuary of the laws?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parbleu! we&rsquo;ve come to learn how to blague,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;We might get
      rusty if we didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go into the garden,&rdquo; said the young man, not observing that
      Gazonal belonged to the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that this new-comer was well-dressed, in black, the provincial did
      not know in which political category to place him; but he followed the
      others into the garden contiguous to the hall which follows the line of
      the quai Napoleon. Once in the garden the ci-devant young man gave way to
      a peal of laughter which he seemed to have been repressing since he
      entered the lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Leon de Lora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, to prove the sincerity of the constitutional government
      we are forced to tell the most frightful lies with incredible
      self-possession. But as for me, I&rsquo;m freakish; some days I can lie like a
      prospectus; other days I can&rsquo;t be serious. This is one of my hilarious
      days. Now, at this moment, the prime minister, being summoned by the
      Opposition to make known a certain diplomatic secret, is going through his
      paces in the tribune. Being an honest man who never lies on his own
      account, he whispered to me as he mounted the breach: &lsquo;Heaven knows what I
      shall say to them.&rsquo; A mad desire to laugh overcame me, and as one mustn&rsquo;t
      laugh on the ministerial bench I rushed out, for my youth does come back
      to me most unseasonably at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; cried Gazonal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found an honest man in Paris! You must be
      a very superior man,&rdquo; he added, looking at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! who is this gentleman?&rdquo; said the ci-devant young man, examining
      Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cousin,&rdquo; said Leon, hastily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for his silence and his
      honor as for my own. It is on his account we have come here now; he has a
      case before the administration which depends on your ministry. His prefect
      evidently wants to ruin him, and we have come to see you in order to
      prevent the Council of State from ratifying a great injustice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brings up the case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our friends Giraud and Claude Vignon are on the committee,&rdquo; said
      Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say just a word to them,&rdquo; urged Leon; &ldquo;tell them to come to-night to
      Carabine&rsquo;s, where du Tillet gives a fete apropos of railways,&mdash;they
      are plundering more than ever on the roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! but isn&rsquo;t your cousin from the Pyrenees?&rdquo; asked the young man, now
      become serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you did not vote for us in the last elections?&rdquo; said the statesman,
      looking hard at Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but what you have just said in my hearing has bribed me; on the word
      of a commandant of the National Guard I&rsquo;ll have your candidate elected&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; will you guarantee your cousin?&rdquo; asked the young man, turning
      to Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are forming him,&rdquo; said Bixiou, in a tone irresistibly comic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see about it,&rdquo; said the young man, leaving his friends and
      rushing precipitately back to the Chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Comte de Rastignac; the minister of the department in which your
      affair is brought up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A minister! Isn&rsquo;t a minister anything more than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an old friend of ours. He now has three hundred thousand francs a
      year; he&rsquo;s a peer of France; the king has made him a count; he married
      Nucingen&rsquo;s daughter; and he is one of the two or three statesmen produced
      by the revolution of July. But his fame and his power bore him sometimes,
      and he comes down to laugh with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! cousin; why didn&rsquo;t you tell us you belonged to the Opposition?&rdquo;
       asked Leon, seizing Gazonal by the arm. &ldquo;How stupid of you! One deputy
      more or less to Right or Left and your bed is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all for the Others down my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &lsquo;em go,&rdquo; said Bixiou, with a facetious look; &ldquo;they have Providence on
      their side, and Providence will bring them back without you and in spite
      of themselves. A manufacturer ought to be a fatalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luck! There&rsquo;s Maxime, with Canalis and Giraud,&rdquo; said Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, friend Gazonal, the promised actors are mustering on the
      stage,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all three advanced to the above-named personages, who seemed to be
      sauntering along with nothing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they turned you out, or why are you idling about in this way?&rdquo; said
      Bixiou to Giraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, while they are voting by secret ballot we have come out for a little
      air,&rdquo; replied Giraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did the prime minister pull through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was magnificent!&rdquo; said Canalis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; repeated Maxime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; cried Giraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! so! Right, Left, and Centre are unanimous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All with a different meaning,&rdquo; observed Maxime de Trailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maxime was the ministerial deputy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Canalis, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Canalis had already been a minister, he was at this moment tending
      toward the Right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but you had a fine triumph just now,&rdquo; said Maxime to Canalis; &ldquo;it was
      you who forced the minister into the tribune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And made him lie like a charlatan,&rdquo; returned Canalis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A worthy victory,&rdquo; said the honest Giraud. &ldquo;In his place what would you
      have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have lied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t called lying,&rdquo; said Maxime de Trailles; &ldquo;it is called protecting
      the crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he led Canalis away to a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great orator,&rdquo; said Leon to Giraud, pointing to Canalis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; replied the councillor of state. &ldquo;A fine bass voice, and
      sonorous, but more of an artist in words than an orator. In short, he&rsquo;s a
      fine instrument but he isn&rsquo;t music, consequently he has not, and he never
      will have, the ear of the Chamber; in no case will he ever be master of
      the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Canalis and Maxime were returning toward the little group as Giraud,
      deputy of the Left Centre, pronounced this verdict. Maxime took Giraud by
      the arm and led him off, probably to make the same confidence he had just
      made Canalis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an honest, upright fellow that is,&rdquo; said Leon to Canalis, nodding
      towards Giraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of those upright fellows who kill administrators,&rdquo; replied Canalis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think him a good orator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; replied Canalis; &ldquo;he is wordy; he&rsquo;s long-winded, a plodder
      in argument, and a good logician; but he doesn&rsquo;t understand the higher
      logic, that of events and circumstances; consequently he has never had,
      and never will have, the ear of the Chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when Canalis uttered this judgment on Giraud, the latter was
      returning with Maxime to the group; and forgetting the presence of a
      stranger whose discretion was not known to them like that of Leon and
      Bixiou, he took Canalis by the hand in a very significant manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I consent to what Monsieur de Trailles proposes. I&rsquo;ll
      put the question to you in the Chamber, but I shall do it with great
      severity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall have the house with us, for a man of your weight and your
      eloquence is certain to have the ear of the Chamber,&rdquo; said Canalis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      reply to you; but I shall do it sharply, to crush you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could bring about a change of the cabinet, for on such ground you can
      do what you like with the Chamber, and be master of the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maxime has trapped them both,&rdquo; said Leon to his cousin; &ldquo;that fellow is
      like a fish in water among the intrigues of the Chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ex-scoundrel who is now in a fair way to become an ambassador,&rdquo;
       replied Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giraud!&rdquo; said Leon to the councillor of state, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t leave the Chamber
      without asking Rastignac what he promised to tell you about a suit you are
      to render a decision on two days hence. It concerns my cousin here; I&rsquo;ll
      go and see you to-morrow morning early about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three friends followed the three deputies, at a distance, into the
      lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin, look at those two men,&rdquo; said Leon, pointing out to him a former
      minister and the leader of the Left Centre. &ldquo;Those are two men who really
      have &lsquo;the ear of the Chamber,&rsquo; and who are called in jest ministers of the
      department of the Opposition. They have the ear of the Chamber so
      completely that they are always pulling it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;let us go back to the rue de Berlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you&rsquo;ve now seen the heart of the government, cousin, and you must
      next be shown the ascarides, the taenia, the intestinal worm,&mdash;the
      republican, since I must needs name him,&rdquo; said Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the three friends were once more packed into their hackney-coach,
      Gazonal looked at his cousin and Bixiou like a man who had a mind to
      launch a flood of oratorical and Southern bile upon the elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I distrusted with all my might this great hussy of a town,&rdquo; he rolled out
      in Southern accents; &ldquo;but since this morning I despise her! The poor
      little province you think so petty is an honest girl; but Paris is a
      prostitute, a greedy, lying comedian; and I am very thankful not to be
      robbed of my skin in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day is not over yet,&rdquo; said Bixiou, sententiously, winking at Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do you complain in that stupid way,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;of a
      prostitution to which you will owe the winning of your lawsuit? Do you
      think you are more virtuous than we, less of a comedian, less greedy, less
      liable to fall under some temptation, less conceited than those we have
      been making dance for you like puppets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad!&rdquo; said Leon, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you already
      promised Rastignac your electoral influence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because he was the only one who ridiculed himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad!&rdquo; repeated Bixiou, &ldquo;why slight me, who am always ridiculing
      myself? You are like a pug-dog barking at a tiger. Ha! if you saw us
      really ridiculing a man, you&rsquo;d see that we can drive a sane man mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation brought Gazonal back to his cousin&rsquo;s house, where the
      sight of luxury silenced him, and put an end to the discussion. Too late
      he perceived that Bixiou had been making him pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five o&rsquo;clock, the moment when Leon de Lora was making his
      evening toilet to the great wonderment of Gazonal, who counted the
      thousand and one superfluities of his cousin, and admired the solemnity of
      the valet as he performed his functions, the &ldquo;pedicure of monsieur&rdquo; was
      announced, and Publicola Masson, a little man fifty years of age, made his
      appearance, laid a small box of instruments on the floor, and sat down on
      a small chair opposite to Leon, after bowing to Gazonal and Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are matters going with you?&rdquo; asked Leon, delivering to Publicola one
      of his feet, already washed and prepared by the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am forced to take two pupils,&mdash;two young fellows who, despairing
      of fortune, have quitted surgery for corporistics; they were actually
      dying of hunger; and yet they are full of talent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you about pedestrial affairs, I want to know how you are
      getting on politically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Masson gave a glance at Gazonal, more eloquent than any species of
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you can speak out, that&rsquo;s my cousin; in a way he belongs to you; he
      thinks himself legitimist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! we are coming along, we are advancing! In five years from now
      Europe will be with us. Switzerland and Italy are fermenting finely; and
      when the occasion comes we are all ready. Here, in Paris, we have fifty
      thousand armed men, without counting two hundred thousand citizens who
      haven&rsquo;t a penny to live upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;how about the fortifications?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pie-crust; we can swallow them,&rdquo; replied Masson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let the cannon in, and, in the second,
      we&rsquo;ve got a little machine more powerful than all the forts in the world,&mdash;a
      machine, due to a doctor, which cured more people during the short time we
      worked it than the doctors ever killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you talk!&rdquo; exclaimed Gazonal, whose flesh began to creep at
      Publicola&rsquo;s air and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! that&rsquo;s the thing we rely on! We follow Saint-Just and Robespierre;
      but we&rsquo;ll do better than they; they were timid, and you see what came of
      it; an emperor! the elder branch! the younger branch! The Montagnards
      didn&rsquo;t lop the social tree enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ca! you, who will be, they tell me, consul, or something of that kind,
      tribune perhaps, be good enough to remember,&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;that I have
      asked your protection for the last dozen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm shall happen to you; we shall need wags, and you can take the
      place of Barere,&rdquo; replied the corn-doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I?&rdquo; said Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you! you are my client, and that will save you; for genius is an
      odious privilege, to which too much is accorded in France; we shall be
      forced to annihilate some of our greatest men in order to teach others to
      be simple citizens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The corn-cutter spoke with a semi-serious, semi-jesting air that made
      Gazonal shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s to be no more religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more religion <i>of the State</i>,&rdquo; replied the pedicure, emphasizing
      the last words; &ldquo;every man will have his own. It is very fortunate that
      the government is just now endowing convents; they&rsquo;ll provide our funds.
      Everything, you see, conspires in our favour. Those who pity the peoples,
      who clamor on behalf of proletaries, who write works against the Jesuits,
      who busy themselves about the amelioration of no matter what,&mdash;the
      communists, the humanitarians, the philanthropists, you understand,&mdash;all
      these people are our advanced guard. While we are storing gunpowder, they
      are making the tinder which the spark of a single circumstance will
      ignite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you expect will make the happiness of France?&rdquo; cried Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Equality of citizens and cheapness of provisions. We mean that there will
      be no persons lacking anything, no millionaires, no suckers of blood and
      victims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&mdash;maximum and minimum,&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said it,&rdquo; replied the corn-cutter, decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more manufacturers?&rdquo; asked Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The state will manufacture. We shall all be the usufructuaries of France;
      each will have his ration as on board ship; and all the world will work
      according to their capacity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Gazonal, &ldquo;and while awaiting the time when you can cut off the
      heads of aristocrats&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cut their nails,&rdquo; said the radical republican, putting up his tools and
      finishing the jest himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he bowed very politely and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can this be possible in 1845?&rdquo; cried Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were time we could show you,&rdquo; said his cousin, &ldquo;all the
      personages of 1793, and you could talk with them. You have just seen
      Marat; well! we know Fouquier-Tinville, Collot d&rsquo;Herbois, Robespierre,
      Chabot, Fouche, Barras; there is even a magnificent Madame Roland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the tragic is not lacking in your play,&rdquo; said Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is six o&rsquo;clock. Before we take you to see Odry in &lsquo;Les Saltimbauques&rsquo; 
      to-night,&rdquo; said Leon to Gazonal, &ldquo;we must go and pay a visit to Madame
      Cadine,&mdash;an actress whom your committee-man Massol cultivates, and to
      whom you must therefore pay the most assiduous court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as it is all important that you conciliate that power, I am going to
      give you a few instructions,&rdquo; said Bixiou. &ldquo;Do you employ workwomen in
      your manufactory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; replied Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want to know,&rdquo; resumed Bixiou. &ldquo;You are not married, and you
      are a great&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Gazonal, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve guessed my strong point, I&rsquo;m a great lover
      of women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! if you will execute the little manoeuvre which I am about to
      prescribe for you, you will taste, without spending a farthing, the sweets
      to be found in the good graces of an actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the rue de la Victoire where the celebrated actress
      lived, Bixiou, who meditated a trick upon the distrustful provincial, had
      scarcely finished teaching him his role; but Gazonal was quick, as we
      shall see, to take a hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three friends went up to the second floor of a rather handsome house,
      and found Madame Jenny Cadine just finishing dinner, for she played that
      night in an afterpiece at the Gymnase. Having presented Gazonal to this
      great power, Leon and Bixiou, in order to leave them alone together, made
      the excuse of looking at a piece of furniture in another room; but before
      leaving, Bixiou had whispered in the actress&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;He is Leon&rsquo;s cousin,
      a manufacturer, enormously rich; he wants to win a suit before the Council
      of State against his prefect, and he thinks it wise to fascinate you in
      order to get Massol on his side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Paris knows the beauty of that young actress, and will therefore
      understand the stupefaction of the Southerner on seeing her. Though she
      had received him at first rather coldly, he became the object of her good
      graces before they had been many minutes alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; said Gazonal, looking round him disdainfully on the
      furniture of the salon, the door of which his accomplices had left half
      open, &ldquo;that a woman like you should be allowed to live in such an
      ill-furnished apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, indeed! but how can I help it? Massol is not rich; I am hoping
      he will be made a minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a happy man!&rdquo; cried Gazonal, heaving the sigh of a provincial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; thought she. &ldquo;I shall have new furniture, and get the better of
      Carabine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear!&rdquo; said Leon, returning, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be sure to come to
      Carabine&rsquo;s to-night, won&rsquo;t you?&mdash;supper and lansquenet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will monsieur be there?&rdquo; said Jenny Cadine, looking artlessly and
      graciously at Gazonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; replied the countryman, dazzled by such rapid success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Massol will be there,&rdquo; said Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo; returned Jenny. &ldquo;Come, we must part, my treasures; I
      must go to the theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal gave his hand to the actress, and led her to the citadine which
      was waiting for her; as he did so he pressed hers with such ardor that
      Jenny Cadine exclaimed, shaking her fingers: &ldquo;Take care! I haven&rsquo;t any
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the three friends got back into their own vehicle, Gazonal
      endeavoured to seize Bixiou round the waist, crying out: &ldquo;She bites!
      You&rsquo;re a fine rascal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So women say,&rdquo; replied Bixiou.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock, after the play, another citadine took the
      trio to the house of Mademoiselle Seraphine Sinet, better known under the
      name of Carabine,&mdash;one of those pseudonyms which famous lorettes
      take, or which are given to them; a name which, in this instance, may have
      referred to the pigeons she had killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carabine, now become almost a necessity for the banker du Tillet, deputy
      of the Left, lived in a charming house in the rue Saint-Georges. In Paris
      there are many houses the destination of which never varies; and the one
      we now speak of had already seen seven careers of courtesans. A broker had
      brought there, about the year 1827, Suzanne du Val-Noble, afterwards
      Madame Gaillard. In that house the famous Esther caused the Baron de
      Nucingen to commit the only follies of his life. Florine, and
      subsequently, a person now called in jest &ldquo;the late Madame Schontz,&rdquo; had
      scintillated there in turn. Bored by his wife, du Tillet bought this
      modern little house, and there installed the celebrated Carabine, whose
      lively wit and cavalier manners and shameless brilliancy were a
      counterpoise to the dulness of domestic life, and the toils of finance and
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether du Tillet or Carabine were at home or not at home, supper was
      served, and splendidly served, for ten persons every day. Artists, men of
      letters, journalists, and the habitues of the house supped there when they
      pleased. After supper they gambled. More than one member of both Chambers
      came there to buy what Paris pays for by its weight in gold,&mdash;namely,
      the amusement of intercourse with anomalous untrammelled women, those
      meteors of the Parisian firmament who are so difficult to class. There wit
      reigns; for all can be said, and all is said. Carabine, a rival of the no
      less celebrated Malaga, had finally inherited the salon of Florine, now
      Madame Raoul Nathan, and of Madame Schontz, now wife of Chief-Justice du
      Ronceret.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered, Gazonal made one remark only, but that remark was both
      legitimate and legitimist: &ldquo;It is finer than the Tuileries!&rdquo; The satins,
      velvets, brocades, the gold, the objects of art that swarmed there, so
      filled the eyes of the wary provincial that at first he did not see Madame
      Jenny Cadine, in a toilet intended to inspire respect, who, concealed
      behind Carabine, watched his entrance observingly, while conversing with
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Leon to Carabine, &ldquo;this is my cousin, a
      manufacturer, who descended upon me from the Pyrenees this morning. He
      knows nothing of Paris, and he wants Massol to help him in a suit he has
      before the Council of State. We have therefore taken the liberty to bring
      him&mdash;his name is Gazonal&mdash;to supper, entreating you to leave him
      his full senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as monsieur pleases; wine is dear,&rdquo; said Carabine, looking Gazonal
      over from head to foot, and thinking him in no way remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal, bewildered by the toilets, the lights, the gilding, the chatter
      of the various groups whom he thought to be discussing him, could only
      manage to stammer out the words: &ldquo;Madame&mdash;madame&mdash;is&mdash;very
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you manufacture?&rdquo; said the mistress of the house, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say laces and offer her some guipure,&rdquo; whispered Bixiou in Gazonal&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La-ces,&rdquo; said Gazonal, perceiving that he would have to pay for his
      supper. &ldquo;It will give me the greatest pleasure to offer you a dress&mdash;a
      scarf&mdash;a mantilla of my make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, three things! Well, you are nicer than you look to be,&rdquo; returned
      Carabine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris has caught me!&rdquo; thought Gazonal, now perceiving Jenny Cadine, and
      going up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the actress, &ldquo;what am I to have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I possess,&rdquo; replied Gazonal, thinking that to offer all was to give
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massol, Claude Vignon, du Tillet, Maxime de Trailles, Nucingen, du Bruel,
      Malaga, Monsieur and Madame Gaillard, Vauvinet, and a crowd of other
      personages now entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a conversation with the manufacturer on the subject of his suit,
      Massol, without making any promises, told him that the report was not yet
      written, and that citizens could always rely on the knowledge and the
      independence of the Council of State. Receiving that cold and dignified
      response, Gazonal, in despair, thought it necessary to set about seducing
      the charming Jenny, with whom he was by this time in love. Leon de Lora
      and Bixiou left their victim in the hands of that most roguish and
      frolicsome member of the anomalous society,&mdash;for Jenny Cadine is the
      sole rival in that respect of the famous Dejazet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the supper-table, where Gazonal was fascinated by a silver service made
      by the modern Benvenuto Cellini, Froment-Meurice, the contents of which
      were worthy of the container, his mischievous friends were careful to sit
      at some distance from him; but they followed with cautious eye the
      manoeuvres of the clever actress, who, being attracted by the insidious
      hope of getting her furniture renewed, was playing her cards to take the
      provincial home with her. No sheep upon the day of the Fete-Dieu ever more
      meekly allowed his little Saint John to lead him along than Gazonal as he
      followed his siren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, Leon and Bixiou, who had not seen Gazonal since that
      evening, went to his lodgings about two in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, cousin,&rdquo; said Leon, &ldquo;the Council of State has decided in favour of
      your suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, but it is useless now, cousin,&rdquo; said Gazonal, lifting a melancholy
      eye to his two friends. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve become a republican.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; asked Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything left; not even enough to pay my lawyer,&rdquo; replied
      Gazonal. &ldquo;Madame Jenny Cadine has got notes of hand out of me to the
      amount of more money than all the property I own&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is Cadine is rather dear; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I didn&rsquo;t get anything for my money,&rdquo; said Gazonal. &ldquo;What a woman!
      Well, I&rsquo;ll own the provinces are not a match for Paris; I shall retire to
      La Trappe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Bixiou, &ldquo;now you are reasonable. Come, recognize the majesty
      of the capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of capital,&rdquo; added Leon, holding out to Gazonal his notes of hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazonal gazed at the papers with a stupefied air.
    </p>
    <p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by John Bickers, and Dagny, and David Widger


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation&rsquo;s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
